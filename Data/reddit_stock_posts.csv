Lamb Weston Earnings Play,"So $LW - Lamb Weston was scheduled to release Q1 earnings tomorrow morning, but now it looks like it may be delayed by a day.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and say it is likely a third quarter of shitty results in a row. To begin with, never a good sign if the call gets delayed.

But the real reasons are much more tangible. Lamb Weston Meijer, their huge European venture was for a very, very long time a 50/50 joint venture so their activity never flowed into results, so when they had a bad year it didn't really matter. They bought it out a couple years ago now. This is relevant because in Europe a very significant amount of the processing potatoes are not contracted, farmers sell them open in the market...and this summer prices were near record highs all season. This means their COGS in Europe are likely super high. There have been shortages of potatoes in Europe and a lot of the crop has had issues driving the price up. In addition it sounds like seed potatoes aren't great meaning they likely have to forecast higher costs for those.

In the US, most of their business is contracted for 1-2 years. So they lost a lot of business when they fucked up their ERP, and it is unlikely they would have gained much of any of that back by now. They had to pick up other business through heavy discounting, and I would expect that to continue. Especially since this has been dubbed the ""summer of value"" for all the big quick serve restaurants, and regular restaurant traffic has declined per recent results.

They had some kind of epic fuck up with McDonald's Korea, which drove the chain to stop selling fries in the entire country for like 2 weeks. They disclosed this event in the last earnings call, but it is possible as  the fallout continues there will be additional costs, because it had to be very serious.

Their retail division seems to have given up. It was one of their biggest drivers of growth through covid. Now, they have increased competition and aren't doing anything. Simplot effectively bought Ore-Ida and has revitalized that brand, and McCain (the largest fry producer) has entered into many retail spaces in the US, both of these companies have been discounting to gain market share. Lamb launched their Grown in Idaho brand like 5 years ago to be a middle tier product, now with others discounting, it is one of the most expensive. They also seem to have lost lots of freezer space.

Their ERP upgrade is still likely going on and draining more money. This may end up being just about the most money any company has ever shelled out for one when you look at cost to market Cap.

They have a plant in South America, which has also seen a potato crisis, much worse than Europe. So that facility is probably bleeding money. They were also building out a new huge facility expansion, but to put it in perspective their most recent China plant got delayed well beyond their initial schedule, how the hell do you think it is going to go in Argentina. I'd expect that will be delayed quite a bit because nothing happens fast there, period. Delayed = more expensive. And honestly no idea what kind of moron thinks buying a business in Argentina, which is in competition for the worst economy of the century in the world, is a great deal...and then to double down. CEO must have had some bad advice.

At this point one of the biggest hindrances appears to be the C-Suite. It looks like the CEO has never had to manage failure, and is hapless and unable to course correct...because this is a long time now and there has been no real plans it seems apart from hoping things get better.

Definitely getting puts, not as much as I have previously. But will look to see how things sit at the end of the day. It is possible they pull out a win because they have proved their ability to forecast is dog shit.

TLDR
French fries good, bad management equals puts

What will happen to RMB as the Chinese QE continues? Will Chinese GDP continue to grow at the same rate? ,"It’s clear that one of the major motivate of the current QE like stimulus package in China is to maintain a high GDP growth. However, GDP is usually measured in USD and a prolonged QE will put huge devaluation pressure on RMB which will translate to a shrinking GDP due to exchange rate shift. 

I’m sure there is plans to deal with this, since GDP growth has always been what China cares the most, but what would it be? RMB is actually growing stronger recently against USD despite the QE efforts. ",2,1727714844.0,https://i.redd.it/m05lrhp97zrd1.jpeg

10 stacks on CAT calls to run up before earnings,"Caterpillar (CAT) reports earnings between the 25th and the 30th, with most estimates being the 29th. (They haven't announced the date yet.) I bought 7x NOV 1 CALL 390 contracts to profit from a run-up in IV.

Based on my model of historical pre-earnings IV, even if CAT stays flat or dips a little bit, these options should move up in price. They're at 29.8% IV right now, with vega of 0.46 and theta 0.24. Here's a monte carlo simulation, where the horizontal axis is number of days remaining until earnings are released.

https://preview.redd.it/2r8tpd0z1zrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=907aa6ffabe68795bd4938e63c9e659a4aa1ae03

From top to bottom, the red lines are the 90th percentile, mean (expected value), 10th percentile, and 1st percentile of the expected contract price. Because of the way that IV increases as earnings get closer, the distribution of daily log-returns of the stock, and the relative values of vega and theta, I think it's likely that the price increase from delta and IV will outpace the price drop from theta.

I think the stock will rise over the next few weeks as folks prep for earnings, because:

* They've been giving conservative guidance this year, which has been accurate re: revenue and customer inventories, but they are still outperforming in terms of profit.
* Forecasters have consistently underestimated CAT EPS, so they consistently post an EPS beat.
* Only one of their major competitors reports in the next couple weeks, so there's little risk of a big shock to the stock price. The rest of their competitors all report around the same time they do.
* The fed rate cut and pre-election favorable oil prices may soon increase customer heavy equipment purchases, as customer purchase and operating costs will be down.
* The stock market often runs up prior to an election, so the overall trend should be up.
* CAT also has a strong drift component this year, so there's not much reason to expect a drop.

I'm planning to hold for the next few weeks, taking profit at +25% or loss at -25%. If IV doesn't rise to 30% over the next two weeks I'll probably close no matter what.

Important - this model is new, and might be buggy, so keep in mind that you're on WSB and I'm probably an idiot.",5,1727714257.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ft01hp/10_stacks_on_cat_calls_to_run_up_before_earnings/

Boeing below $150 by the end of the week?,"Ever since the strike has started, the management of Boeing seems to have tried to release a trickle of ""good"" news in order to keep the markets hopes in a swift resolution of the strike up.

I think the ""best and final"" offer, which boeing directly sent to the workers and the media, without awaiting a response from the union, was rather directed at the marked than at the employees.

However, now that the new round of talks failed, there is not much left to keep the market happy. I mean sure, the boeing stock is cheap now. But it will most likely be even cheaper in two or three weeks or so.

As far as I see, the Management of Boeing seems to be misjudgeing how frustrated and angry it's employees are. They seem to be trying to keep the stock price from falling to fast in order to avoid stop-loss sell offs.

However, I really don't see any reason to buy the stock now, when the strike is dragging on.

"Helene Destroys Spruce Pine, NC Ultra-Pure Quartz Mining Operation. Short NVDA?","There is a location in North Carolina that produces essentially the global supply of ultra pure quartz. The quartz is needed for czochralski crucibles, don't ask me what that means, I don't know. These are essential for the production of basically every type of semiconductor. See this article: https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/

The company, Unimin (parent company - Sibelco) has it's main production facility in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. Rumors indicate that the town has been wiped off the face of the Earth. https://x.com/FossilLocator/status/1840218595541778791

Production has been hauled for the foreseeable future. There are some alternative methods to produce this material, but people are saying that this accounts for over 90% of the world's supply and this material is critical. The backup company in the US is The Quartz Company, which is also located in Spruce Pine, and is probably also gone too.

I am trying to figure out who would be screwed the most from this. I'm sure it's a gamble, but some of the big semiconductor companies are going to be railed with no more supply of their fine powder. Thoughts on who to short?
I'm thinking NVDA, TSM, AVGO, AMD, TXN, QCOM.
Any other ideas?

That location is about 767m above sea level. Coordinates: 35°54'58""N 82°04'13""W. Flood looks like a meter or two. So lets say that everything below 768m flooded at some point in the last few days.

Sibelco has their mine at 35°53'52""N 82°03'40""W, which is like 800m above sea level, so that's probably fine minus road damage from falling trees.

Quartz Co has an operation on the river 35°55'37""N 82°05'36""W with a ton of equipment (presumably railroad shipping) that sits below 765m. Safe to say that area has been underwater.

8 reason to YOLO $NIO today,"Alright, guys. Consider this a follow-up to my last NIO post. I bought some Nio call earlier and its printing, I’m selling off some of my other holdings to ride this trend when the market opens.

https://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255

It might sound crazy, but hear me out—here are 8 reasons why I’m YOLO-ing into NIO right now:

**Fed cutting rates** – The Fed’s already cutting, and they’re likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don’t fight the Fed*—when they cut, the market goes up.

**China stimulus** – The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index—stocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won’t be short because China’s economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn’t even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.

**Chinese economy recovery** – Like I said, this isn’t a short-term bull. It’ll probably last a year or two. China’s economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I’ve seen posts from Chinese forums—some people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.

**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** – Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you’ll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.

**NIO is even cheaper** – NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It’s been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month’s price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO’s sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.

**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** – The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it’s a piece of cake.

**NIO’s next two earnings are going to be huge** – They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.

**A turning point is coming** – If 0nvo’s sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they’ll scale production and cut costs. They’re also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about here.

Anyone worried that Tech is lagging?,"Yeah I get it. Bers are ghey and technicals is astrology.  
  
One thing that strikes me odd from looking at charts is that the tech index QQQ didn't make a new ATH yet whereas the more balanced market index SPY did. Tech is normally the sector that leads during the early stages of bull markets, like what we saw in 2020 and this year too. This is generally because that industry benefits the most from ""easy"" money. But then it eventually lags as investors re-allocate into other sectors that have cheaper valuations. This is why I think we're seeing QQQ lag behind SPY recently. On the surface this isn't bad, but these market rotations do sometimes coincide with market cycles. 

Ultimately recession will be the determining factor if this bull cycle ends; however, the charts kind of look analagous to late 2021/early 2022.

As we see the dollar weaken, and USA rates go down, it is a reasonable play.  We are already seeing China pop on the stimulus news.

  
Seems like the timing is right, and EEM is a reasonable place to start. Seems like we are just getting started and there is a fair about of upside to the trade. Would wait for some pullback before starting a position.

  
While I see the upside, got burned on BABA before so I think I am gonna hold in cash and my edv position and roll back into megacap tech on a pullback.

IonQ ($IONQ) DD: Summary of IonQ's Presentation and a Reflection on the Roadmap. Why I believe calls will print after the next earnings.,"# The Introduction

https://preview.redd.it/o6qy9qz6trrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=8609a76921232ad0ea1f905003931eab7b1adebb

IonQ will announce an application that can be run on their upcoming hardware during their next earnings call in November. I think that the announcement will make calls print for weeks to come. In this article I'll be going over why I have come to that conclusion after listening to the company [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rHLtBP04aY) at the Quantum World Congress 2024.

IonQ's Peter Chapman started the talk titled 'Building a Large Global Quantum Business' by giving updates on the business side, while Dean Kassmann would talk later about the technical milestones achieved.

# Business update

# Exponential development rate of QC tech

Chapman started the talk with a surprising insight: ""First, I want to say that I think quantum is accelerating much faster than most people thought it would.

""Contrary to many opinions expressed on Reddit, YouTube, and across social media regarding the maturity of the quantum industry, experts generally agree that 'real' useful solutions are at least 10 years away.

Having Chapman, the CEO of arguably the leading quantum company, assert that the development and deployment of quantum computers are occurring much faster than anticipated presents a clear contradiction. Either the experts in quantum computing and physics are correct in their collective estimates, or IonQ's management is advancing quantum technology faster than expected.

There is a clear gray area in the debate concerning the realistic timeline for bringing advantageous quantum computing systems to market.

# Scaling IonQ to $1 Billion

https://preview.redd.it/n402o09vtrrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7203b71a6dc70188688cbf389b8f5ef3d423d55

Chapman continues by stating that the business part of the presentation will focus on the topic of 'scaling a quantum computing company to reach $1 billion.

# A brief history

""In 1995, IonQ had its breakthrough when Chris Monroe and others developed the very first quantum logic gates. This initial breakthrough led to a seed round 10 years later, marking the beginning of the company.

From 2016 to 2021, we raised two additional VC rounds and created multiple versions of hardware (five generations) in an academic setting. During this time, quantum physicists assembled these systems at the IonQ laboratory. I believe the following gives great insight into the company culture and vision of its people. Business analysts, take note:'

When I joined the company, there was no intention of… The board told me, “Don’t worry about selling systems, and don’t worry about the competition; just build the best hardware.” And that’s what we did.'

With this mentality, the first IonQ roadmap was built.""

# From an academic setting to production

https://preview.redd.it/xczuxnlztrrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=129f337aa56236a347edd307052a4d85ddf2227c

""Even without sales, IonQ had significant luck at that time by raising money, which later allowed the company to transition from academic systems to engineering and building 'real' quantum products.

The shift from the academic phase to the engineering phase required IonQ to think creatively about how to build the product. IonQ began hiring people with backgrounds in product development and large-scale sales. A manufacturing plant was established in Seattle, enabling in-house assembly based on engineering drawings.

'We reached a great milestone; quantum computers built at IonQ are not assembled by physicists, as we want them focused on next-generation systems rather than assembly line work.'""

# Always 3 generations ahead in systems

Having this system designed, where one part of the staff focuses exclusively on creating next-generation products, really makes me think about Tencent.

$TCEHY has divided its team into two groups: one group consists of developers who create the games sold to gamers, while the other comprises financial officers who aim to invest that newly acquired capital and generate returns. This approach seems to be a gold standard across great high-margin businesses. 🤔

# Scaling out to focus internationally

“When you start to ship products, you need to scale your sales team internationally and build a field service organization to support the machines you just sold in places like Japan.

And can you break your machine down into parts, put it into containers, and ship it across the world?

These are the little details that most people don’t consider in quantum, according to Chapman. IonQ’s advantage lies in their preparedness for every small detail and their ability to work several generations ahead into the future.”

# Sales and revenue numbers

""IonQ is approaching $100 million in bookings this year, which shows that 'quantum' is indeed a viable business. We've achieved this in record time—going from $0 to $100 million in bookings in just four years.

https://preview.redd.it/qegvhzx7urrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03ecb0962b78b7bfa45ab6cdf23191bdea1a3a8

  
If you look up how long it took the largest companies to reach $100 million, you'll find that it took Microsoft about 10 years to achieve that milestone. Microsoft was founded in 1975, and in 1985 they had [surpassed](https://archive.org/details/01-microsoft-annual-reports/Microsoft%20Corp%20%28MSFT%29%20Annual%20Report%2C%201986/page/n21/mode/2up?view=theater) that number in annual revenue.""

https://preview.redd.it/hqos14g9urrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3fb595bae2b3d93f8ab68c4cfd6889f96867a7e

While realized revenue and bookings are not the same, and it took Microsoft 10 years to reach that revenue, achieving $100 million in bookings in just four years is still an impressive accomplishment for IonQ.

# Getting to $1B in revenue: IonQ's plan

Chapman continued: ""You need to have international sales, and you're also going to need an application that can deliver value and be used by Fortune 1000 companies, hopefully across entire industries, which can generate $100 billion in revenue on its own.""

""And in fact, at the upcoming earnings call, we will discuss the first of many applications that we believe will be enabled by our upcoming hardware. So it's a really exciting time because we're approaching a place in the Noisy intermediate-scale quantum ([NISQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era)) era that can deliver that value ($100B).""

This is next-level thinking. Here are three key points:

1. Chapman believes that this application will be used industry-wide, indicating a broad solution that multiple parties can benefit from.
2. He suggests that it could be worth $100 billion on its own.
3. This is linked to international sales, as going international is a requirement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, alongside having a strong application. Shipping an app worldwide as part of a package with their hardware, already indicated to be ready for production, with detailed planning for assembly, shipping, and support teams—makes an international approach sensible.

https://preview.redd.it/d23yorocurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c1486067137dc72d4a1a1c458847d8cc4d72db

Chapman continues to refer to the large number of quantum hardware systems required to achieve $1 billion in sales. ""If you're going to generate $100 billion and you need 50 computers, you better be able to manufacture those 50 machines. And the cost per Qubit better be much lower than it is today.""

""A secret hiding in plain sight is that to scale up to a billion dollars, you have to scale all the other parts of your business, not just the hardware. I think that IonQ is unique in that this is exactly what we're doing right now.""

Consider their strategic approach of working on several future generations at once, planning months ahead, and their efforts to become a software company as well. This strategy facilitates [easy access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv0kHl8imEE&t=406s) to their hardware by integrating drivers from all their competitors. I believe IonQ's team has been extremely busy over the past few months.

In preparation for international sales, IonQ has been focused on delivering results, and now we’re starting to see the details of their work.

# A paradigm shift, coming next earnings call

""We're scaling up manufacturing for the application that will require tens, if not hundreds, of quantum computers.""

Wait a minute. This is it. Every time I listen to this presentation, I keep discovering new insights. Peter Chapman just mentioned that this upcoming application will need 10 to 100 quantum hardware systems. What kind of application could be so impactful that it requires this many systems, more powerful than supercomputers?

I believe this is the industrial paradigm shift we've all been waiting for. An [announcement](https://investors.ionq.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx) regarding this program is expected on November 11th.

https://preview.redd.it/jy7yuiglurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d80861428363add86e4d706fa6e1ab8ff02fee0

# Technical achievements

Dean Kassman took over from Peter Chapman to shift focus and discuss the milestones achieved.

""Peter has talked about enterprise-grade solutions; I’m going to discuss performance and some aspects of physical scale.""

""Our North Star is a balanced approach among the following components:""

https://preview.redd.it/w86vuupnurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec93583c73ffe8d8dae291c6f13f5e322fa546b2

# Commercial advantage through the right choices

IonQ's management believes that achieving their goal of becoming a $100 billion quantum enterprise requires three key components.

""Scale is our North Star. We build it through both modularity and all other engineering best practices we have in place. The key contributors to scale are the ability to connect Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) together.""

""QPUs in a single machine (trapped ions) start as a linear chain in our architecture and evolve into multi-core systems. They then transition from multi-core to connected multi-cores.""

Path: Trapped Ions > Multi-Core > Connected Multi-Cores.

[This is based on the same principle as NVLink, which connects GPUs together.](https://preview.redd.it/320nckqpurrd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5204ba58c921ef1b4849ee038c465fb99579e520)

# Quantum network effects

""We have discussed a set of milestones in our overall path to connecting QPUs:

https://preview.redd.it/pym8w7asurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0f5ec292b3704263481713a3310fe922613d24

That slide begins with an analogy to local area networks. It starts with a single point, then progresses to point-to-point connections, and eventually leads to many-to-one connectivity.

We've highlighted four milestones here, but there are many more we can include to provide additional context. The beauty of what we're doing is that it doesn't require any changes to the architecture.

Operating effectively in a room-temperature setting (even though data centers tend to be a bit cooler) is ideal, as it allows the world to adopt IonQ's systems without needing to alter their environments.""

# In Full Forte: IonQ's keys to high performance

""IonQ's barium bet is paying off. 'We have been making continuous progress on our barium technology. This validates the overall approach we have taken with our development systems as we move toward Tempo.

''Tempo has been in the works for a while, and our advancements in barium demonstrate the viability of our technical path as we continue to deliver.'""

# Closing remarks

""We're really excited to share the path we're on and welcome you to learn more about our systems. Thank you for your attention.""

With their recent update on securing a $54.5M contract, IonQ further proves its path to success in achieving the milestones outlined in its roadmap.

Scam company by Ex-TESLA and FB employees?!? FACEDRIVE (FD.V)-> ARGO Corporation (ARGH.V),"I don't know if you guys know this company called ARGO Corporation (ARGH.V), this company was previously called FACEDRIVE (FD.V). It was ride sharing company that pretty much got so much fkn funding from the Canadian government and went from couple cents to $60 fkn dollars during covid. Apparently, it was a pump and dump. People made so much money but those that got bag held at the top filed a lawsuit and the CEO (Sayan Navaratnam) stepped down from CEO and he can't start another company for 3 or 4 years.

Anyway, this is where it gets interesting. Now, this company, about last year, changed its name to Argo Corporation (ARGH.V). Essentially now they ""provide public transportation and mobility technology solutions in Canada"". They are looking to make autonomy busses that will power the whole transportation system in all provinces.

The co-founders of this new company is Praveen Arichandran who was **head of growth at Tesla,** Qamar Qureshi **president of Kowledgehook**, Sisun Lee previous **product manager at Facebook**, and Holly Lim **CFO of Google's Sidewalk Labs**. The team here is fkn crazy, I mean wtf, like top guys coming to Canada from Silicon Valley to make a transportation company in Ontario which is heavily operated by Metrolinx (funded by the Government of Ontario) and in the near future they are looking to make all transportation electric and autonomous.

Is this just another pump and dump, I mean since late last year the stock did some crazy numbers, but I don't know what to make out of this. Just another pump and dump or an actual company that’s looking to forget the past and actually do something for the future?

Smart money may have called the top is in,"https://preview.redd.it/0uooczp5gnrd1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd70349ac267a1434349e4cd554ff3491a1ec60a

Before you say *ah shit here we go again with another regard screaming ""recession""* let me preface by saying I'm still bullish on the market in the near term.

Here I present to you one of the charts of all time. Those squiggly lines in blue show the confidence spread of smart money to retail. Think of it like this, institutions (aka smart money) are long term investors that are greedy when retail is fearful and fearful when retail is greedy, which here means that peaks are when smart money is calling the bottom and buying and valleys are where only retail is playing. In other words, a trough signals a reversal is likely in the near future and the market is too expensive.  
  
Now if you look carefully you'll see smart money isn't always successful at calling the top and if retail continues to buy strongly they eventually FOMO back in. But in places where the graph has dropped into a trough rapidly, a downturn follows. We have some time before smart money confidence bottoms but we're likely not too far away.

A few things I've noticed on the market that support this theory:  
1. Volumes have been lower recently, which could mean retail activity is the dominant force in the market right now  
2. Soft landing is not a guarantee although the odds are alright for now, but retail is euphoric about it and we're heading into extreme greed  
3. Smart money may be risk-off till after the election  
4. Valuations are insane right now. Banks, energy, some pharma, and telecom are the only sectors not overvalued to the tits in the S&P 500

End of the day I'm just another regard like you but I think the time has come to be cautiously optimistic. I'm setting some sensible stop losses on my holdings. End of the day I hope I'm wrong and the top is not even close but tread carefully in the next few months",143,1727573863.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1frtfxq/smart_money_may_have_called_the_top_is_in/

why the economy is doomed. A samsclub paper towel perspective.,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this due diligence on the economy.

Over the last 4 years I have gone to my local samsclub to purchase paper towels over 800 times. every week for 4 years, I purchased a 12 pack of bounty select a size paper towel. 

During covid paper towel like toilet paper became a rare resources. It was not guarenteed that the economy could produce enough to sustain the paper towel needs of the citizens. This lead to the terrible pratice of hoarding paper towl and while sad, was very bullish for the economy in general.

After witnessing this sad pratice of hoarding I began to realise that the broader market could be tracked (in generalities) by following how much paper towel my local sams club could keep in stock. I keep track of this number by creating an acronym for these amounts of paper towel stored on pallets at the previously mentioned club. 

S.P.T.P Sams club paper towel pallets. (by creating this acronym I have saved not only myself time while writing, but also you time while reading)

Back during the covid days my local samsclub rarely had more than 2 s.p.t.p delivered a week. buying paper towel was hit or miss. As the economy recovered this increased to a more reliable 4 s.p.t.p.

Now we come to the crux of this post. s.p.t.p remained steady in the 2 to 10 range for the last 3 or so years. Untill this very week. I counted over 45 s.p.t.p on rakes strewn throughout the store. Which leads me (and you if you have even an average IQ) to 1 conclusion. 

No one has extra money to buy paper towel anymore. The economy is toast. Over. To say the world is ending is not even one tiny bit of an exageration.

On monday I will sell every asset I own and fullport into week puts on whatever sector produces paper towels. 

I hope you have the sense to follow this amazing play to prevent ultimate finacial ruin to me (and you)

Thanks again for reading. Best of luck out there.


Edit. As we enter a new week I wanted to thank everyone who replied to this post. Especially the humorous ones that gave me some great laughs. I even learned a few things too.

Part 2: Archer Aviation is a Table Pounding Buy as the Grizzly Research Report Caused Over ~27% Short - Dare I say I stand with Cathie Wood,"I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1for7pv/the_time_has_come_for_archer_aviation_achr_evtol/) wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.

Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.

First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \~19% and \~22% short  in the eVTOL startups respectively.

Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.

[Grizzly's article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):

1. **Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.
   * **Reference**: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.""
2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.
   * **Reference**: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.""
3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.""
4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.
   * **Reference**: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.""
5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.""
6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.
   * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.""
7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""

All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024.

1. **\*\*\*Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.
      1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.
      2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract
2. **\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Reality**: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report.
      1. **Ongoing Flight Testing**: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed **daily test flights** in preparation for their **FAA certification** and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested​.
      2. **Video Footage Authenticity**: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the **U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program**, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing.
3. **\*\*Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Reality**: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments.
      1. **United Airlines** has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In **August 2023**, United was part of a **$215 million investment** round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a **$10 million pre-delivery payment** for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft​.
      2. **Stellantis**, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In **January 2023**, Stellantis committed **$150 million in equity** and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the **Midnight eVTOL**. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer.
      3. **Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024**, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million.
4. **\*\*\*\*\*FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Reality**: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification.
      1. **Significant FAA Milestones Achieved**: Archer has made substantial progress in its **FAA certification** pathway: **Final Airworthiness Criteria**: On **May 23, 2024**, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the **FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria** for the **Midnight** aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification​. **Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate** and **Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate**: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations
      2. **For-Credit Flight Testing**: As of **September 2024**, Archer successfully completed **402 test flights**. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for **for-credit flight testing**, which is expected to begin in **early 2024**​.
      3. **Delivery to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
      4. **Part 135 Certification**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
5. **\*\*\*Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them.
      1. **Collaboration Instead of Defeat**: The settlement has evolved into a **collaboration agreement** between Archer and Wisk, with **Boeing** as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become **Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology**. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft.
      2. **Boeing Investment**: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a **significant investment** in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines**. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome.
6. **\*\*\*Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.
      1. **San Jose Facility**: Archer completed the installation of its **high-volume battery pack manufacturing line** at the **San Jose Integrated Test Lab** in **May 2024**. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to **15,000 battery packs per year**, a crucial step toward scaling production​.
      2. **Conforming Midnight Aircraft**: Archer’s **first conforming Midnight aircraft** is expected to be completed in **Q4 2023**, with flight testing set to begin in **early 2024**. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress​.
      3. **Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility**: In addition, Archer began construction on a **high-volume manufacturing facility** in **Covington, Georgia** in **March 2023**. This facility, projected to support the production of up to **650 eVTOL aircraft per year**, is on track for completion in **2024**, ahead of the **Midnight** eVTOL’s planned entry into service in **2025**. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to **complete construction by the end of the year** as of July 2024.
7. **\*\*\*Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Reality**: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis.
      1. **Stellantis Partnership**: Since **August 2023**, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing **$55 million** following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to **650 aircraft annually** once their **Covington, Georgia** facility is operational​. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.
      2. **Wisk/Boeing Settlement**: The **Boeing/Wisk** settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to **autonomy technology**, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a **$215 million** funding round, which included other major investors like **United Airlines** and **ARK Invest**. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs.

As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.

If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.

Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.

https://preview.redd.it/xdgt42wvnmrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e74db783587a8c3b4bf1d44326a0d5ced3c474

My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations.

This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.

Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.

**Update**: [Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-achr-percent-advance-2024-09-27/).

Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from [MarketBeat.com](http://MarketBeat.com), Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00.

**Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](https://verticalmag.com/news/faa-soon-to-release-final-sfar-for-powered-lift-aircraft):

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”

“I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \[industry\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”

The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.

Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.

However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.  
“There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \[the rule\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”

While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release.  
There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",121,1727563998.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1frqceh/part_2_archer_aviation_is_a_table_pounding_buy_as/
Why a Qualcomm takeover of Intel is hard to make work,"Found this article about the Qualcomm takeover of Intel.   
You guys think Granny is happy about this?  
--------------------

# [Why a Qualcomm takeover of Intel is hard to make work](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-qualcomm-takeover-intel-hard-141757123.html)

Intel stock climbs as Apollo Global Management ([APO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APO?.tsrc=fin-srch)), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, [reportedly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-22/apollo-is-said-to-offer-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-intel) offered a multibillion-dollar investment. That came after [reports ](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d)that Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM)) approached Intel with a buyout offer. Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst, joins Morning Brief hosts [Brad Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/) and [Seana Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/) to discuss the legacy chipmaker’s position amid reported takeover and investment opportunities.

Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance he has “a hard time seeing that deal work, especially if the fabs are included, and the issue is that they're losing a lot of money right now.” A fab is a semiconductor fabrication facility, a factory that makes chips.

“Qualcomm would probably have to use a lot of stock. If they did a stock deal, it's significantly dilutive for Qualcomm. It could be 20% or even more dilutive, and the problem is if they start borrowing money and adding cash, the leverage goes up really, really high, really, really quickly.”

https://preview.redd.it/uy2gr7kiemrd1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6776ee2bd49ddedc6b223c6fe2c2555530b72

The analyst says, “I have a really hard time seeing it work with the fabs. I'm not sure that they could do a deal without the fabs,” as, in his view, they couldn’t spin off their fab businesses into independent companies, but they can’t scrap them. “I don't think that that's politically viable at this point,” as the US prioritizes its position in the global chip market.

He adds, “I'd rather not see Qualcomm do a deal like this. I think it's hard to do a deal where I think the risk would justify the returns on this. We'll see if they can construct something. But I don't really like it. So I'm hoping we don't have something like this.”

Regarding the potential Apollo investment, Rasgon highlights that Apollo has an [existing relationship](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-apollo-agree-joint-venture-200500820.html) with Intel. The analyst says that while neither party has confirmed the reports that Apollo could invest up to $5 billion in Intel, the story could be viewed as “a vote of confidence” in the company.

Rasgon says the regulatory side of a potential Qualcomm takeover is “really tough,” though he notes in the US it “could be easier” as its “a US national champion buying a national champion.”

He says, “There are very few areas where Qualcomm and Intel really overlap,” with the auto space being one. He explains that Intel and Qualcomm have likely discussed Intel divesting from Mobileye ([MBLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MBLY)) if there is a takeover.

"A ‘iPhone of AI’ Makes No Sense. What Is Jony Ive Really Building along with Laurene Powell Jobs, OpenAI and Sam Altman? Why Apple is pissed","The Wire's article asks the question, ""[What is Jony Ive Really Building?](https://www.wired.com/story/jony-ive-iphone-of-ai/)"". But it's more complicated than it might appear. 

Recently, it was reported that [Apple is backing away from the upcoming investment round for OpenAI](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/apple-drops-out-talks-join-openai-investment-round-wsj-says-2024-09-28/). There seems to be something afoot and Apple maybe completely caught off guard here. It's not just OpenAI and Jony Ive making a device. Mark Zuckerberg is proving that he wants no part of Apple's walled garden either via a recent release of a bunch of cool hardware that uses AI and no Apple influence whatsoever. And, Mark was more than happy to work with Xbox/Microsoft for future capabilities of the Oculus Meta Quest VR/AR headset. 

If you're tracking, it's becoming clear that the top tier innovators that are building user products don't want Apple as a gatekeeper affecting profits, form, and function of what it is they can and cannot build. 

What is also damning is that Apple believes they can get away with not having to invest any real effort into AI with not only a late rollout but seemingly not very advanced AI capabilities via Apple Intelligence. So much so, they had to partner with OpenAI in order to provide a path for giving users an ""advanced"" model when it is something Siri can't handle. I don't even know what or how that is supposed to work well in practice but it is something both OpenAI and Apple thought was acceptable enough to do the deal in the first place. 

But the lessons and traps here are historically available of what Apple always does when using third party capability for then themselves to take over and provide first party capabilities. Look no further than Apple maps. Eventually, they'll catch-up enough to not make the deal really worth it in the long run. But who knows, maybe it is beneficial for Apple and Google to exist this way. If you look at Android then the guess is, not really. In a way, it's a grand compromise. 

The OS controls all and no matter what advancements in technology you have (Including Super Advanced AI/AGI/ASI) at the end of the day you are still susceptible to the delivery mechanism that technology is realized on; The OS or server providing API which is also on an OS but that's another topic.

The gatekeeping and filter nature of the OS is not be underestimated and many wish they didn't have to deal with it. For Apple users it provides a privacy comfort that many people appreciate. For aspiring startups and new tech is simply a pain in the ass. 

This is where OpenAI, Jony Ive and Miss Jobs come in. Taking a lead from Zuckerberg they too want to build their own device that isn't bound by the restrictions and available capabilities that are provided by iOS. 

What's interesting here, very interesting, is that Steve Jobs wife and initial Apple innovation director Jony Ive are seemingly so done with Apple that they believe the time is not to go at it themselves. The game is set and the match is getting setup. Apple does not have enough AI IP to combat what is about to come to fruition with OpenAI's LLM dominance. Apple capex and massive stock buyback announced last quarter is an obvious reminder to anyone paying attention that they literally almost completely missed on AI. They even reported that they hadn't ""bought"" any Nvidia chips as if nobody would notice they also hadn't built anything great with AI either. Instead choosing to carefully craft using a third party IP to *fill-in-the-gap*s until they can really figure out what to do next. 

Make no mistake, Sam's sights are set on making a first party OS built on AI. No, it won't be the iPhone of AI but rather it will be an Operating System built on and for AI. This is something that Apple knows they will not be able to compete with as Siri has no proof or shown existence of being capable to even remotely compete with any of the large foundational LLM's from Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, or OpenAI. In this race they are last and eventually it is going to bite them. 

It won't happen overnight but if anyone remembers blackberry it takes just one device to change the game. 

The app store that OpenAI will provide will be one that can be of an AI Agent App Store that can function all capability semantically rather than through a touch screen. Want to order an Uber, just tell your agent to do it. Want to pay a bill, just tell your agent to do it. Want to call a restaurant and make reservations, just tell an agent to do it. Want to send that email to your boss in response to the email they sent earlier in the day, just tell an agent to do it. It's a world that doesn't exists on iOS and as of this moment, can't. 

I don't know how long this plays out and no hard details have been released yet but the pieces on the board are clear and they are in motion. Interesting times ahead. 

I have a position in Apple and will be watching this space closely. ",0,1727544039.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1frj9q1/a_iphone_of_ai_makes_no_sense_what_is_jony_ive/

How To Play the Alien Invasion of October,"Hey guys. I know it’s a heavy topic we have to deal with today, and I know it’s Saturday which is when everyone is off doing their most important work of the week, but I couldn’t leave my fellow well-regarded degenerates out in the cold.

The top analysts at the world’s foremost center for NHI analysis and behavioral study, r/aliens, predict that at the end of this month, a 70-year-old contract between the US and the dominant species of NHI visiting Earth will expire. Given the extreme importance of such a global event and its wide-ranging implications for the future of humanity as a species, I feel it’s important that we all come together and attempt to hammer out the best strategy for how to play this on the stock market now, before the proverbial feces hits Cramer’s wildly panning cameras. 

Here’s the sauce (one of many), for anyone who still believes anything as mundane as ‘details’ still matter in this late hour of humanity’s brief history:
https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/s/5n8JJNN2CX

To get the ball rolling, I have a few ideas:

Firstly, I would go long on WMT. Remember when COVID hit and everybody started eating toilet paper? Yeah, double that. Paper towels too. Very bullish on WMT during invasion. 

Secondly, I would short insurance—UNLESS it comes out that every CEO of every insurance company on Earth is already an alien. Which, actually, we already know they are. So go long insurance, because that’s the winning team. I have always loved insurance and I just want to take a moment to say publicly that I did not teach my children that most of it is a scam. 

Thirfthly, strongly consider a full port into UVXY, because the VIX is going to Hulk dick as high and as hard as….. uh, as Hulk’s dick. (I can’t afford a ghost writer.) Unless alien invasion is already priced in, which is likely at this time of year. Your call. 

Interested to see other thoughts and potential plays. It also occurred to me to start going to superstores and asking for all their discarded boxes, just in case cardboard is gold to the aliens. Seems like a good hedge.

Are Hamilton Morris and Jason Wallach’s 100+ patents on new psychedelics priced into CMPS?,"The only source I know of for this info is from Hamilton’s podcast on patreon. Most of the posts about CMPS on this sub are around the IPO expecting it to do big things, and it hasn’t really. I haven’t found the patent yet, but he mentions some cool things like selenium derivatives. 

My ignorant guess is that it’s not priced in yet. And will be a very long time before and of those potentially hit the market, or even become gray market material. 

Their project started over 10 years ago before the so called “psychedelic renaissance “ before there was this much public interest in commercialization of psychedelics. 

Discloser of conflict of interest and my positions : 

I’ve been long on CMPS for over a year and I bought my first options contract yesterday. I have 1 contract, a call @ $7.65 on 10/18. The current price is $6.81

This is definitely not financial advice.

China Gains!,"1.2k turned into 13k, thank you PDD BABA and JD

I am myself a Chinese citizen, came to the US and studied for 7 years. Now I've worked for 1.5 yrs, just paid off some money I borrowed from my family. Being debt free, I looked into investing 3 months ago, started by doing day trading on a paper account for a few weeks, kind of understood generally how short term trades work, and it certainly helped me in doing 1dte and 0dte SPY options later on.

However, with my minimal initial capital, investing in stocks have very diminishing returns. I then thought options is literately perfect. If I loss everything, it doesn't matter, I am young and don't really have much in hand anyway. But if I win big, I can have a meaningful starting capital to do some more stable investing with more meaningful returns. I put a month's paycheck minus rent into options gambling and started the journey right as the July huge dip happened.

For the next two months, it was really meh, sometimes I win, but there were a few times when I was down 80% and bounced back. My downfall is holding on to gains for too long... and they just fizzle out later (its almost like if I browse WSB daily XD).

Around last week, my mom also gave me a speculative 1.5k for investing in the US, since China has been in a multi-year shit market. She told me exactly which stocks to buy, but gave me free control over 200$ of it in options play.

Finally the day came. Wednesday I turned 200$ into 600$ on PDD calls during trading hours, sold the gains and bought 1.2k worth of OTM PDD, BABA, and JD calls expiring on Friday right before close. Overnight I watched the Hang Seng index, the SSE index, and JD/BABA charts on HSE, and I almost shitted myself... JD rose 10% overnight, and PDD gained 12 dollars. I immediately closed all these positions in the morning.

Now, my initial investment has almost 5x'ed, and my mom's money also 2.5x'ed. I can finally do fun things like the wheel strategy, and investing in stocks will now have meaningful returns. I put almost all my investment money + a bit more deposits into stocks, and left out 500$ to keep gambling in options. I told my mom to do the same with her money, and I will keep doing options with 300$ of it. If somehow I can 10x this, I will pull out the majority into stocks, and repeat with 1000$ for options play. Currently I have already 2x'ed that 500$.

Now my positions...

I still think the Chinese economy is being driven by the ccp into a dumpster, and the stimulus, at least in the near future, won't fix it at all. However, I will continue to ride this wave of Chinese market rally for some time. I think there's gonna be around another week's worth of gains on the table. Though now I have no Chinese options held over the weekend, most of my money are in various Chinese stocks, and they most likely will go into SPXL, MOAT, gold and some selected US stocks after this wave of rally fades.

Hopefully next week Chinese stocks make me proud and 10x my options play money again.",43,1727496868.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fr6731/china_gains/

What the impending stagflation in Russia (might) mean for you: An in-depth look,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM**

If anyone else has seen the latest Business Insider article regarding the fears of an impending stagflation event in Russia, you might be wondering what that means for you and your investments. If you look back on charts of where Russia invaded Ukraine, you can see where the markets tanked. If you want to try to get ahead of something similar this time, read on. Spent a solid chunk of time putting it together for you all. Please note, this is nothing more than info for you to base your own ~~gambles~~ DDs on.

Anyways, here's a \[paywall-free version of the article\](https://archive.ph/2024.09.26-143200/https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-economy-outlook-stagflation-recession-inflation-gdp-growth-ukraine-war-2024-9), as well as a rundown of what it (might) mean for the broad markets as a whole.

Full disclosure, I worked on this using the latest and best GPT model o1-preview, which is shockingly good at reasoning. Whether that makes you discredit the content is up to you, but it’s been tested to be on par with individuals with PhD’s.



**The Significance of This Event**

Russia's looming stagflation—a combination of economic stagnation and high inflation—could significantly disrupt global markets due to the country's substantial role in exporting energy, metals, and agricultural commodities. Supply chain disruptions and reduced exports from Russia may lead to increased global commodity prices, affecting various industries. Companies and sectors capable of capitalizing on these shifts or mitigating associated risks are likely to see notable impacts on their financial performance.

# Sectors That May See Positive Gains, Broken Down by Key Companies

**Energy Sector**

With potential reductions in Russian oil and gas exports, global energy prices may rise, benefiting companies that can fill the supply gap or profit from higher prices.

* **Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN: LNG)**
   * **Reasoning:** As the leading U.S. exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Cheniere is well-positioned to meet increased European demand seeking alternatives to Russian gas.
* **EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG)**
   * **Reasoning:** EOG's strong position in U.S. shale production allows for rapid increases in output, capitalizing on higher oil and natural gas prices.
* **Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE: PXD)**
   * **Reasoning:** Pioneer, with its substantial Permian Basin operations, can benefit from elevated crude prices and increased domestic production.

**Renewable Energy Sector**

Accelerated transition to renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels may benefit companies in this sector.

* **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)**
   * **Reasoning:** First Solar's U.S.-based manufacturing and thin-film solar technology position it to meet increased demand without the supply chain risks associated with overseas suppliers.
* **Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENPH)**
   * **Reasoning:** Enphase's microinverter technology is critical for solar installations, and increased global demand for solar energy can drive growth.
* **Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE: BEP)**
   * **Reasoning:** With a diversified portfolio in hydroelectric, wind, and solar assets globally, Brookfield Renewable can capitalize on the shift towards clean energy.

**Defense Sector**

Heightened geopolitical tensions may lead to increased defense spending globally.

* **Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC)**
   * **Reasoning:** Northrop Grumman's expertise in defense electronics, aerospace systems, and cybersecurity makes it a key beneficiary of increased defense budgets.
* **BAE Systems plc (OTC: BAESY)**
   * **Reasoning:** As a major global defense contractor, BAE Systems could see increased orders from NATO countries boosting their defense capabilities.
* **General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: GD)**
   * **Reasoning:** General Dynamics' production of military vehicles, ships, and communication systems positions it to benefit from increased military procurement.

**Agriculture Sector**

Disruptions in Russian grain exports can lead to higher global agricultural commodity prices.

* **The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS)**
   * **Reasoning:** As a leading producer of potash and phosphate fertilizers, Mosaic may benefit from higher fertilizer prices due to reduced exports from Russia and Belarus.
* **CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CF)**
   * **Reasoning:** CF Industries, a major nitrogen fertilizer producer, stands to gain from increased global demand for fertilizers amid supply constraints.
* **Deere & Company (NYSE: DE)**
   * **Reasoning:** Farmers may invest in advanced agricultural equipment to boost productivity, benefiting Deere's sales of machinery and technology solutions.

**Metals and Mining Sector**

Supply disruptions of key metals from Russia can lead to higher prices and increased demand for alternative suppliers.

* **Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA)**
   * **Reasoning:** As a major aluminum producer, Alcoa can benefit from higher aluminum prices due to reduced Russian exports.
* **Sibanye Stillwater Limited (NYSE: SBSW)**
   * **Reasoning:** With significant operations in palladium and platinum mining, Sibanye Stillwater may gain from higher prices resulting from supply shortages.
* **Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE)**
   * **Reasoning:** Vale, a leading global producer of nickel, could benefit from increased nickel prices and demand, crucial for stainless steel and battery production.



# Sectors That May Be Hit the Hardest, Broken Down by Key Companies

**Automotive Sector**

Automakers may face challenges due to shortages and higher prices of metals like palladium and nickel.

* **Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F)**
   * **Reasoning:** Ford's production costs may increase due to higher prices for essential metals, potentially impacting profitability and pricing strategies.
* **General Motors Company (NYSE: GM)**
   * **Reasoning:** Similar supply chain pressures as Ford, with potential delays in electric vehicle (EV) production due to nickel shortages.
* **Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)**
   * **Reasoning:** Tesla's reliance on nickel for EV batteries may lead to increased costs and supply constraints, affecting production targets.

**Aerospace and Aviation Sector**

Dependency on Russian titanium and increased fuel costs can negatively impact this sector.

* **The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA)**
   * **Reasoning:** Boeing's supply chain may be disrupted due to reliance on Russian titanium, essential for manufacturing airframes.
* **Airbus SE (OTC: EADSY)**
   * **Reasoning:** Airbus also relies on Russian titanium and may face similar production challenges.
* **Airlines**
   * Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL)
   * American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL)
   * United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL)
      * **Reasoning:** Higher jet fuel prices increase operational costs, and economic uncertainty may reduce demand for air travel.

**Technology Sector**

Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers may be affected by shortages of critical materials like neon gas and palladium.

* **Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)**
   * **Reasoning:** Supply chain disruptions in raw materials could impact semiconductor production volumes and costs.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)**
   * **Reasoning:** NVIDIA may face challenges similar to Intel, affecting the supply of graphics processing units (GPUs).
* **Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)**
   * **Reasoning:** While Apple has diversified suppliers, disruptions in global supply chains and increased component costs could impact production and margins.

# Positively Impacted ETFs

* **Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLE)**
   * **Reasoning:** Contains major oil and gas companies benefiting from higher energy prices and increased global demand.
* **iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ: ICLN)**
   * **Reasoning:** Invests in clean energy companies that may see growth due to accelerated renewable energy adoption.
* **VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSEARCA: MOO)**
   * **Reasoning:** Provides exposure to global agribusiness companies likely to benefit from higher agricultural commodity prices.
* **SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSEARCA: XME)**
   * **Reasoning:** Includes companies involved in the extraction and production of metals, which may gain from higher commodity prices.

# Negatively Impacted ETFs

* **U.S. Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA: JETS)**
   * **Reasoning:** Contains airline stocks potentially affected by higher fuel costs and reduced travel demand.
* **Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA: CHIQ)**
   * **Reasoning:** While not directly linked to Russia, global economic slowdown may impact consumer discretionary spending in major markets like China.
* **VanEck Vectors Russia ETF (NYSEARCA: RSX)**
   * **Reasoning:** Direct exposure to Russian equities, which are significantly impacted by sanctions and economic instability.
* **Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: LIT)**
   * **Reasoning:** Companies involved in battery technology may face supply chain challenges and increased costs due to metal shortages.

# Conclusion

In reassessing my recommendations, I have refined the list of companies and ETFs to ensure they represent the most strategic picks for investors considering the potential impacts of Russia's stagflation on global markets.

Russia's stagflation presents a complex landscape for investors, characterized by both risks and opportunities. Sectors such as energy, defense, agriculture, and renewable energy are likely to experience positive impacts due to increased demand, higher commodity prices, and global shifts in energy policy. Companies within these sectors are positioned to capitalize on market gaps and heightened geopolitical tensions.

On the other hand, industries heavily reliant on Russian imports, facing supply chain disruptions, or contending with rising input costs may encounter significant challenges. Aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, and certain technology companies may see reduced profitability and operational difficulties.

For investors, a strategic approach involves focusing on sectors and companies poised for growth amid these global changes. Allocating resources to positively impacted ETFs can offer diversified exposure to these opportunities. However, it's essential to remain vigilant, as the situation is fluid, and geopolitical developments can rapidly influence market dynamics. Continuous monitoring and a willingness to adapt investment strategies are crucial in navigating the complexities arising from Russia's economic conditions.

Investors should conduct their own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.

**TL;DR**: Russia’s potential stagflation could disrupt global markets, especially in energy, metals, and agriculture. Sectors likely to benefit include energy (e.g., Cheniere Energy), renewable energy (e.g., First Solar), defense (e.g., Northrop Grumman), agriculture (e.g., Mosaic), and metals (e.g., Alcoa). Sectors that may suffer include automotive (e.g., Ford), aerospace (e.g., Boeing), technology (e.g., Intel), and consumer goods (e.g., PepsiCo) due to supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices.",0,1727477273.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fr0abv/what_the_impending_stagflation_in_russia_might/

"Nike: A high value play, just do it ","Summary:

Nike offers a strong investment opportunity due to its leading market position, solid brand equity, and long-term growth strategies. While facing short-term challenges from competition and changing consumer preferences, Nike's initiatives like product refreshes and significant advertising investments are expected to boost sales recovery. Its transparent cost structure and stable gross margins highlight financial resilience. Given its current valuation, analysts rate Nike as a ""Buy,"" with a target share price of $107.



3 months ago I posted about McDonald's. The stock was trading at around $250, fast forward and here we are at above $300 a share. If you missed out on this nugget here's your chance. In this write up we'll take a look at my next high value growth pick, Nike.


Nike (NYSE:NKE) represents a strong investment opportunity due to its leading market position, robust brand equity, and strategic focus on product innovation and market expansion. With sales of $51.4 billion last year, Nike operates globally across major regions including North America, EMEA, China, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. North America accounts for about 40% of its revenue, while EMEA contributes 26.5%.

Despite facing short-term challenges from increased competition and changing consumer preferences, Nike maintains a transparent cost structure and stable gross margins, bolstered by substantial advertising investments exceeding $4 billion annually. The footwear segment drives over 65% of sales, and the company's strategic initiatives aim to refresh its product range to enhance sales growth.

Competitive pressures, particularly from Adidas and local brands in various regions, are noted, but Nike’s management anticipates a recovery in market share and revenue by fiscal year 2025. Analysts rate Nike as a ""Buy,"" with a target price of $107, citing its adaptability and strong fundamentals as key factors for long-term growth.

Nike faces several potential risks as a consumer cyclical company, including:

1. **Economic Slowdown**: A decline in consumer spending due to worsening macroeconomic conditions could negatively impact sales.
2. **Product Competitiveness**: Failure to launch new models successfully could result in a loss of market competitiveness.
3. **Trade Tensions**: Ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China may complicate production and distribution.

In terms of valuation, Nike is viewed as a mature company in a highly competitive market, making significant sales growth challenging. The recent decline in share price, attributed to slower growth and heightened competition, presents an attractive entry point, with the business currently valued below its 2018-2019 levels despite its expansion. Analysts expect a return to steady growth as Nike refreshes its product offerings and consumer trends evolve.

The target share price is set at $107, based on a 24.9x forward EV/EBITDA multiple and an estimated 5% annual EBITDA growth rate.

In conclusion, investors should recognize the cyclical nature of the fashion and athletic footwear industry, where short-term fluctuations can lead to long-term growth. Nike, with its stable gross margins and effective cost management, is well-positioned to navigate these challenges.

Given its current market valuation and anticipated recovery in financial performance, Nike is rated as a ""BUY"" with a target share price of $107. This assessment is based on the company's strong fundamentals and strategic growth initiatives.

Tesla more like Deadsla,"Hello fellow regards and thank you for coming to my Tesla talk. Today I am going to explain the bear case for TSLA in the short term

1. I’m not a super technical trader/indicator freak, but TSLA is currently near or above overbought territory on every RSI timeframe, including 1mo, 3mo, 1y, and 5y. This can be explained by the hype surrounding delivery numbers, upcoming robotaxi event, and earnings. RSI is not the end all be all for a stock’s price but it’s good to note

2. TSLA has been on a tear recently as investors are pricing in good delivery numbers, a successful robotaxi announcement, and good earnings. All it takes is ONE of these events to go poorly and investors will panic

3. ROBOTAXI EVENT - this will probably be the biggest influence in the stock price for the short term, and I don’t think it will go well. Apart from Tesla’s history of screwing up announcements (see 6% drop after cybertruck fail), I simply don’t think Tesla has the technology to compete with Waymo, the main competitor for this type of product. Waymo is backed by google, a HUGE cloud storage provider. This means they’re able to train their models with more data, more TPU infrastructure, and a better AI team. Tesla, on the other hand, uses a vision-only model that requires a MASSIVE amount of data to be stored in places they don’t have. This is shown in their latest FSD versions, which experience about 180 miles per critical error. For reference, human drivers experience about 100,000 miles per critical error and Waymo is at 17,000. Unless Tesla is prepared to unleash some magical new tech stack that they’ve been hiding for some reason, I don’t think they have the tech to release a safe robotaxi to compete with Google. Safety is huge in the driverless car space, because most consumers are already on the fence about being a passenger in one. One misstep in the rollout and TSLA bears would have a field day. I also think that Elon is too full of himself to admit some of these things, so he would happily march out a product that isn’t ready for the public to use rather than acknowledge Tesla’s FSD shortcomings

4. Future events - the nice thing about delivery numbers, robotaxi event, and earnings being in a span of a few weeks is that IV shouldn’t be a huge factor until after everything is all said and done, and you could probably make money buying puts OR calls before the robotaxi event and simply selling the volatility. 

Obviously nobody can predict how earnings will go, but I think one of the main reasons investors give for Tesla’s ridiculous PE is its market share, advanced technology, and production ability in the EV space. While I still think it has some upside for those reasons, I think other EV companies are chipping away at all 3. You can go on google right now and find open source code that performs nearly as well as Tesla’s FSD and vision models.

TL;DR - I think there is more downside opportunity than upside with Tesla, and I think bad performance in upcoming numbers and events will tank the stock that has risen 25% in the last month

And with the market willing to accept that Gyna's crazy stimulus will help their economy, one can only deduce that oil should also run as the economy should be projected for more growth etc.

RKLB - a DD for Simple Jacks,"RKLB is complicated. It’s a rocket and rocket systems end to end company.

I’ve seen many confuse it with RKT- a mortgage company, that is how regarded people are.

If you read my DD on HIMS it was much more complicated.  If you traded on that, congrats you are up 18% in less than a month.

I’ve done similar research on RKLB and taken a $12k position in calls expiring January.

Here’s the quick DD:

They make rockets, and successfully launch satellites into orbit for small and medium size satellites.

Spacex has a sort of monopoly on launching the larger satellites with larger rocket, Falcon 9.

RKLB, is making a rocket to compete with falcon 9 and will be done in a year or so.

Spacex has a $200B or so evaluation.

RKLB has a $4B evaluation.

200/4=50 

50x gain opportunity.  And that’s just shares.

With options napkin math you can 5-10x ur gains if you pick the right contracts.

So there’s a 250x return here just waiting to be taken.

Risks people keep saying that aren’t true:  “they will go bankrupt their cash burn is crazy!”  

They are actually profitable if you don’t include what they are spending for the next year or 1.5 years to finish their falcon 9 competitor rocket, which is the whole point of the thesis.

They have executed flawlessly on building many rockets so far that are putting satellites into space.

There is a more complicated platform play here for the true artists.

But personally I like to keep it simple:

250-500x return on long calls, 50x return on shares.

RocketLab Research,"# Valuation

Typical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential.

For RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation.

The important question is: **How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner?**

# Probability of Neutron Success

To estimate the likelihood of Neutron’s development success, we can examine RocketLab’s past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services.

**Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles**

**Electron Timeline**

2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year.

2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced.

2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification.

2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called “It’s a Test.” The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: *When the Heavens Went on Sale* - Ashlee Vance).

2018 January: First successful Electron launch.

2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive—just two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week.

**Falcon 1 Timeline**

2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave).

2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas).

2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave).

2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor).

2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing.

2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure).

2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight.

**Summary**

It took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight.

**Additional Points:**

    SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).
    
    RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it’s not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.
    
    SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn’t an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.
    
    RocketLab, however, couldn’t hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn’t access certain US aerospace supplies.

Despite being in an outsider position—not based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson—RocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight.

**Bonus:** Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites.

**What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron?**

In addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process.

The biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk.

**Neutron Timeline**

2021 March: Neutron introduced.

2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced.

Q2 2023

    First full-scale thrust chamber completed.
    
    Injector testing underway.
    
    Pre-burner tests underway.

2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner.

2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production.

**My Prediction:**

    •	First Neutron flight: 2025.
    
    •	First successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.
    
    •	First successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.
    
    •	First Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing.

Intel: Five reasons why the bottom is in,"1. **The CEO:** Only time will tell if PattyG is the Tony Stark of semiconductors or its Joey Tribbiani. But dude is workin hard to improve products and cut costs, including via layoffs (15%, ouch!) and capital expenses (paused fabs in Poland & Germany)
2. **The USA:** Uncle Sam's got Intel's back! It’s like getting a golden ticket from Willy Wonka, but instead of chocolate, it’s billions in funding to boost their foundry business. So far, $8.5B under Chips Act + $3B from DOD. Sweet! Talk about a sugar rush.
3. **The Rumored Buyers:** I think the whole Qualcomm buying Intel was just a head fake Qualcomm CEO Cristiano has a history of trolling the plebs he doesn't like. Both companies have too much product overlap for this to have ever made sense.The Apollo $5B thing is more real as they have already invested $8B in Ireland
4. **The Tech:** Their Lunar Lake Laptop AI CPU is finally kicking some butt. Using 3nm TSMC, it has the fastest process whereas the competition (AMD & Qualcomm) are still at 5nm process, and s.l.o.w. AF.  Meanwhile on the foundry side, Intel got AMZN & other deals lined up for their 18A process with shipments for next year. Hallelujah!
5. **The Charts:** The technicals look better everyday. It’s trading above the 12 and 55 moving averages like a pro athlete clearing hurdles. And the RSI? It’s giving us the thumbs up, saying, ‘Nope, not overbought yet, keep on keepin' on!’ It's up 27% since it hit rock bottom on September 10.

When you put all of this together, it's hard to imagine the stock price going lower. Investing in Intel now is like betting on a field goal kicker - mostly you'll win, sometimes you'll win big, but sometimes you can lose big too. But, hey, it sure beats being a Jags fan in 2024!

This is why call/put spreads can be a double edged sword,"As you all know, I got extremely lucky with Micron, even after selling 45% of my position before the report. I was able to maximize my gains to some degree utilizing 105/110 call debit spreads expiring today with the 55% I left in micron. They had a max profit of $25,000 with the $5000 equity I placed in it. However, the rules on spreads are tricky. Even though Micron peaked at 114.80 yesterday, you cannot get max profit from spreads until the close on Friday. This meant I had 2 choices. 

1. Sell the spreads below max profit to someone who believed micron would close above 110

2. Hold the spreads in hopes it would close above 110. 

I chose the latter and closed my spreads at 3.60, or $360 a spread. I had purchased 60 of them for $81. 

Fast forward to today and the spreads have dropped significantly. They are trading at around $229 give or take. So had I held, I would currently be down $7000 from where I decided to sell. 

TLDR: if you’re up big on a spread, even if the spread is in the money, don’t risk it especially if the stock is volatile. If micron for some reason dropped below 106, the spreads would have been red. ",9,1727449703.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fqpyl4

Chinese Consumer Lending Stocks,"I did a post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/mALfsGQdBR about this a while back but figured I’d give it a refresh given some of the recent buzz around China. Full disclaimer I have about 40% of my portfolio in Yiren, which is the entirety of my China exposure. 

These Chinese consumer lending companies are high margin service businesses and the valuations are really low. Many have high dividend yields and stock buyback programs. The loans are low dollar amount revolver loans typically used for everyday consumption (not debt refi or consolidation) with 4-8% normal default levels and high interest rates in teens, similar to credit card loans in the US. 

Stimulus and low rates were a boon for credit card and consumer lending businesses in America coming out of Covid, I don’t think it’s a stretch to think there will be a similar outcome for China. In total these companies originated $198B in loans in 2023. This is definitely an interesting group of beaten down Chinese stocks with a lot of upside potential.

* **Bank Health:** Poor loan performance can lead to increased loan loss provisions, erosion of investor confidence. *(Bear) (High)*
* **Federal Reserve Limitations:** The Fed can provide liquidity support but cannot bail out every bank; widespread failures could lead to systemic risk. *(Bear) (High)*
* **Investor Concerns:** Bad loans can lead to losses for investors; panic can trigger broader market instability. *(Bear) (High)*
* **""Pray and Delay"" Approach:** Postponing actions can create uncertainty and volatility. *(Bear) (High)*

**Final Scores**

* **Bullish Total:** 15 points
* **Bearish Total:** 53 points
* **Neutral Total:** 11 points

**Overall Sentiment**

The U.S. economy continues to display a predominantly bearish outlook, driven by rising interest rates, contraction in manufacturing, and softening labor data. Though durable goods excluding transportation show core demand resilience, broader economic risks remain. Consumer activity remains strong in some areas, yet housing, manufacturing, and labor market weaknesses raise concerns of further deceleration.

🥚 Eggflation Is Back 🥚 ,"“A quick reminder, we’ve been here before: Many costs soared during the pandemic, including food items, but the price of eggs was a special case. The average price per dozen of Grade A eggs surged from less than $1.50 in January 2021 to nearly $5.00 in January 2023, per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. That’s a price increase of more than 200%.”

“Then, last month’s consumer price index showed a number that was reminiscent of the pandemic era eggflation: Egg prices rose more than 28% year-over-year in August, by far the biggest climb of any individual food item.”

https://www.sofi.com/article/money-life/eggflation-is-back/

“It’s unsure when eggflation will come down. But it’s also unlikely that we’ll see a price hike like we did during the pandemic, when a lot of different factors weighed on wholesale prices.”

“That said, the egg industry remains heavily consolidated, which is unlikely to help get prices down. As of 2020, five companies controlled more than a third (36% to 40%) of egg production in the U.S., according to a Farm Action report.”",1,1727394148.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fqadxa/eggflation_is_back/

ATAT - Atour lifestyle holdings limited,"Over the last couple of days, I have been looking at a stock that caught my interest. I have been looking at the numbers and I wanted to hear your thoughts. It is a Hong Kong based company trading on the NYSE (under the ticker ATAT).

Gross profit margin: 40% over last 12 months (26-41% each year since 2019)

Operating margin: 21% over the last 12 months

Net profit margin: 17,2% over the last 12 months

Free cash flow: 1,78 billion 

Debt/Equity ratio: 0,7 (down from 1,9 over the last two years)

Dividend yield: 1,8%

Insider ownership: 25% (founder owning about 20%)

Current stock price: $25,47

Doing a discount cash flow analysis on it (FCF), it would justify today’s valuation growing 5% per year (this is the first time so do such calculation, so I might be missing something). 

In Q1 they operated about 1300 hotels and the aim is to operate 2000 of them in 2025.

I bought in for about 5000 USD.

Buying shares of gaming king CD Projekt 2 years before Witcher 4 and CyberPunk.,"What do you think about buying shares of the Polish king of gaming 2 years before the premiere of The Witcher 4? In 2020, before the release of CyberPunk, Red's shares increased by over 300% in 2 years, so someone invested over 50k and made over 200k. Now the situation of this company looks much better, they have huge amounts of cash for investments (almost PLN 2 billion), they are finishing the construction of another large office in Warsaw, and they have built several headquarters in America. They are working on several games at the same time, including the aforementioned Witcher 4, CyberPunk and several other games. The company's potential is great, they have 2 titles with over 95% positive reviews out of approximately 800,000, as well as millions of fans around the world. The price has increased by over 50% this year and the best is yet to come, because the trailer of The Witcher will probably be released in December or May 2025 on the 10th anniversary of The Witcher 3. The release of the trailer will make foreign countries remember about these shares and the course for production will officially begin. The growth this year comes mainly from Polish investors and large investment funds. How do you evaluate such an investment.

Those buying Costco calls today are actually betting against Costco,"Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend 

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky 

- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not 

- eCommerce margins are still unclear ",0,1727366232.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fpzmxx/those_buying_costco_calls_today_are_actually/

Oatly DD: Milk these oat-nipples,"Alright fellow regards

I am no financial advisor or somewhat near (financially) literate enough to give you any of my vanilla-flavoured oat-shit but here we are. As a long-time wsb lurker who likes safe bets, I have witnessed great falls and rises on this subreddit and that is the ship I want to board. Dont be misled by my username, this could be a big PP play.

**Fundamental, schmundamental:** Pick up your crayons and draw your picture. OATLY had high debts, especially in their Asian market lately, and reinvested quite a bit. They were/are on the verge of bankruptcy, which worked as a clickbait for the new CEO in June 2023.

**Jean-Christophe Flatin** (the new CEO) is the boyfriend of wifes. He already led a cat food company (royal canin) and mars as CEO. What comes when you combine catfood and chocolate bars? Thats right, oat milk with a brand name so popular under white girls, it could pass as tears of this Chalamet boy.

**Mommies favorite milk:** One of the reasons why OATLY suffered in the past were the high oat prices, but guess what? The oat price halved since 2022. They also outsourced their awful logistics and concentrated on their core enzymatic procedure making their milk unique. My non-representative survey of my vegan/vegetarian friends (or nice enough people to answer me) resulted in 100% favoritism for OATLY as their milk alternative!

There are two scenarios in my mandala book. Either OATLY goes bankrupt and gets bought by a big company for their name OR they become successful again. Both cases will give me a juicy happy ending as a shareholder.

$Cost dumb reasoning why it will beat earnings ,"1 word: TikTok

More specifically, Costco guys

(I’m Europoor btw, so I’ve never seen a Costco in my life)

Costco guys got millions of views and it’s been used in memes a whole lot and those also got millions of views

I’ve memed about the chicken bake and double chunk chocolate cookie with my friends and we don’t even have a costco anywhere near, I think those memes have had some amount of impact in customers and brand sentiment

Last year on this quarter they had ~79 billion revenue and 4.86 Diluted EPS

The 81 billion 5.1 estimates is easily beatable, they’ve kept beating earnings and this whole viral ordeal is a small, but assuring boost that it will beat earnings again

Hurricane Stocks? Fluor (FLR),"One of the stocks with the most exposure to the hurricane industry is Fluor (NYSE:FLR) and its reach has recently gotten bigger. As of February 8, 2024, Fluor is officially the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency’s direct support for providing recovery services to its East Zone region. Per FEMA, the East Zone consists of Regions III and IV, which encompass the entire eastern seaboard up to New Jersey. 

With large, populous states like Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia falling under its jurisdiction, the East Zone contract provides Fluor with an exceptional revenue stream in the event of a nasty hurricane season. The contract, which operates on indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity has a one-year base period with four, one-year option periods and is valued at up to $525.6 million.

As such, Fluor almost certainly will profit this hurricane season since it has a blank check from the government and because its main competitor for these contracts, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) has fallen out of favor due to the outcome of its recent Hurricane Katrina lawsuit settlement.",11,1727355308.0,https://investorplace.com/2024/05/the-2024-hurricane-season-playbook-3-stocks-to-add-to-your-portfolio-for-massive-gains/

Why I'm holding SOXL Stock Long,"For those who aren’t familiar with SOXL, it is the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares ETF, and it’s built for risk-takers. It gives you 3x leveraged exposure to the semiconductor sector. Translation? If the semiconductor index goes up 1%, then SOXL increases 3x as much. But if it goes down then your losses are triple too. 

# 1. Big Bets on Semiconductors

The semiconductor space is *everywhere*. Think AI, self-driving cars, 5G, cloud computing, etc. All of these need chips, and in huge quantities. With tech demand skyrocketing, semiconductors are starting to become the new backbone of all future tech. We see Intel coming out with new chips, Elon Musk is trying to build out his own supercomputer and has increased orders from Nvidia. 

# 2. Huge Potential Gains

I'm bullish on Semiconductors and believe that not only the semiconductor industry will meet the 2030 heights but also that AI investments will continue to increase. If this is your thought, then SOXL can seriously magnify your profits during strong uptrends.

# 3. The Semiconductor Demand Boom

As industries like EVs, data centers, and IoT have exploded and all require chips.  And companies in this space will continue to profit as demand grows.

I should also be clear that  I'm holding 58.7 shares of SOXL and saw my $1700 turn into $2101.28 (25% return) from September 3rd to now. Planning to hold for at least the next 12-18 months.",8,1727324311.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fpnvw1/why_im_holding_soxl_stock_long/
How would Mag-7 stocks compare against their leverages over 1 year?,"In the attached image you can see a table with screenshots from T212 showing how each Mag-7 stock has done the past year compared to the leverage. 



Insights from the data



$100 invested in every Mag-7 a year ago would be this much today:

\*Meta:\* 190 (100 + 90%)

\*Microsoft:\* 136 (100 + 36%)

\*Amazon:\* 151 (100 + 51%)

\*Apple:\* 129 (100 + 29%)

\*Google:\* 123 (100 + 23%)

\*Tesla:\* 103 (100 + 3%)



In total, the $700 investment would be worth $1132 by now, giving a gain of \*61%\*.

 

The same investment in Mag-7 3x leverages would be this much today:

\*Nvidia:\* 878 (100 + 778%)

\*Meta:\* 380 (100 + 280%)

\*Microsoft:\* 197 (100 + 97%)

\*Amazon:\* 232 (100 + 132%)

\*Apple:\* 170 (100 + 70%)

\*Google:\* 127 (100 + 27%) 

\*Tesla:\* 40 (100 - 60%)



In total the investment would be worth 2024 by now, giving a gain of \*289\*.

OpenAI Pitched White House on Unprecedented Data Center Buildout,"*OpenAI has pitched the Biden administration on the need for massive data centers that could each use as much power as entire cities, framing the unprecedented expansion as necessary to develop more advanced artificial intelligence models and compete with China.*

*Following a recent meeting at the White House, which was attended by OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and other tech leaders, the startup shared a document with government officials outlining the economic and national security benefits of building 5 gigawatt data centers in various US states, based on an analysis the company engaged with outside experts on. To put that in context, 5 GW is roughly the equivalent of five nuclear reactors, or enough to power almost 3 million homes.*

*OpenAI said investing in these facilities would result in tens of thousands of new jobs, boost the gross domestic product and ensure the US can maintain its lead in AI development, according to the document, which was viewed by Bloomberg News. To achieve that, however, the US needs policies that support greater data center capacity, the document said.*

Intel Releases New AI Chips That Beat AMD In Performance and Nvidia in Cost,"“The new Xeon 6 AI performance, which Intel claims is over 5 times faster than the current AMD EPYC CPU, is due to further exploitation of the matrix processors on the Xeon.”

“Intel is betting the success of its Gaudi 3 on its lower price and lower total cost of ownership […] Intel indicated that an accelerator kit based on eight Gaudi 3 processors on a baseboard will cost $125,000, which means that each one will cost around $15,625. By contrast, an Nvidia H100 card is currently available for $30,678, so Intel indeed plans to have a big price advantage over its competitor”

Ignore the rest — it’s written by Yahoo Finance regards who belong here more than most of us. The only reason why I even bothered reading their shit is because the underlying report was done by Bain.

# [Nvidia stock edges up as industry report predicts 'unprecedented levels' of investment in AI data centers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-edges-up-as-industry-report-predicts-unprecedented-levels-of-investment-in-ai-data-centers-172648847.html)

Nvidia stock ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/)) rose more than 2% on Wednesday after an industry report projected ""unprecedented"" levels of investments in artificial intelligence, a bullish sign for the AI chipmaker.

Consulting firm [Bain's annual technology report](https://www.bain.com/insights/ai-changes-big-and-small-computing-tech-report-2024/) published on Wednesday projects that companies will need to make ""unprecedented levels of investment"" in technology infrastructure to stay on top of the artificial intelligence boom.

“If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said.

The firm's research also states data center operators and hardware suppliers will enjoy a short-term windfall as companies and governments splurge on computing capacity.

""Nvidia, for example, projected $10 billion in revenue from governments’ sovereign AI investments in 2024, up from zero last year,"" the report said.

Over the past few months, Wall Street has been searching for clues about how long massive infrastructure spending will last and what the return on investments for AI chip buyers will look like.

On Wednesday, Nvidia stock extended prior session gains after CEO Jansen Huang appeared to have finished selling shares for the time being.

Over the past few months, Huang cashed in on roughly $713 million worth of shares [as part of a plan](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ceo-jensen-huang-sells-713m-141338783.html) to sell 6 million shares by March 2025 — a goal he reached earlier than expected.

Despite his stock sale, Huang continues to hold his position as the company's biggest shareholder.

Nvidia shares are up roughly 20% since Sept. 6. The stock has gained more than 150% year to date.

Google files an antitrust complaint against Microsoft in the EU for stifling cloud competition,"Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft, alleging that they use unfair licensing contracts to hinder competition in the cloud computing sector. Central to their argument is that Microsoft's licensing terms for its dominant products (Windows Server, Microsoft Office, etc.) ""lock in"" clients to using their Azure cloud service, making it difficult for them to switch to other providers.

Google states that these practices force European businesses to pay up to €1 billion annually in licensing penalties to move their workloads to other cloud services. This claim is supported by a 2023 study from CISPE, a cloud computing industry group. Google criticizes these practices as harmful to cybersecurity and innovation.

Microsoft reached a settlement in July with CISPE members to alter its practices. They responded to Google's complaint by pointing to their previous settlement as a resolution of similar issues.

Google, not a member of CISPE and having opted out of the July settlement, continues to press for changes that would allow more freedom for customers to choose their preferred cloud provider without facing restrictive costs or penalties.

RHM will moon in the coming days,"Let me try to explain the situation to you regards as simply as possible:

German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall lost 7% last week after a Bloomberg article about possible peace talks amidst Western allies. (btw Putin has already stated that Russia will not take part in these negotiations)

The market is waiting for a sign as to whether the West will continue to provide money for future arms deliveries. Zelenskyy is presenting his “Victory Plan” to the UN today and will talk to Biden tomorrow. So we are going to get a new point of reference in the next few days.

So far Ukraine's allies have taken the position of supplying the country with enough weapons to prevent a defeat. However, they are not supplying enough for a victory either. (basic american strategy: defeat the conventional russian armed forces with as few (american) losses as possible. also don't escalate into WW3 lol)

The worry now is that the West will give up and force Ukraine into a ceasefire...

That's *not gonna happen.* America wants to slowly bleed Russia dry and has successfully implemented this strategy over the last two years. Nothing will change, because letting Russia win would only lead to bigger problems and show countries like China that you can get away with pretty much anything in the long run. Besides, Russia is facing more and more economic and personnel problems. So an end to the war in which Russia “loses” is also in sight.

I'm sure that Zelenskyy will get new concessions on arms deliveries and aid packages in the coming days and worried investors will be reassured.

Rheinmetall is set for the next few years even without further orders for Ukraine. And the upcoming war between Israel and Hezbollah is not yet priced in either. Germany is a close ally of Israel and may also supply weapons.

Besides bears love RHM at the moment:

Mainly betting on the upcoming Unity 6 launch that’s supposed to come with AI features—figured I’d try to ride the AI hype. Plus, the new CEO from Zynga seems promising. Dropped $800 on the bet, hoping he can turn things around. The guy’s got solid gaming industry experience, and most of Unity’s clients are in gaming anyway.

Also thinking the Fed rate cuts and China’s stimulus will help push things up. I’m shooting for a 5x return at least. Unity’s stock has tanked over 90%, so I’m hoping it’s time for a comeback, maybe even a big one if the new CEO nails it.

DIS 120C June'2025 Expiration - to the moon,"TLDR; Buy DIS 100C around June'2025 expiration - or go regard mode and buy 120C for Dec'2024

See attached DIS weekly chart for details.

DIS has been beaten down and on a downtrend since 2021 - from ATH of 203s and currently trading around 93s. Been consistently forming Lower-High and Lower-Lows since 2021, and found bottom around 79s in Oct 2023. Made a Higher-High early this year around April 2024, and been on a downtrend since then till it found support around 84s in early August this year. Last week's candle broke that downtrend since April - and DIS is going to start a strong uptrend move from here.

DIS expected to retest 120s in next 10-12 months, and probably even go higher beyond that.

For regards: Buy 120C for Dec'2024.

Or play safe and buy 120C for June 2025.

**Crayons logic**

* Lower-Highs and Lower-Lows since 2021
* Bottomed out around 79s in Sept-Oct last year in 2023
   * Last Lower-Low before finding bottom was around 84s in December 2022
   * Took about 9-10 months to find bottom from last Lower-Low in December 2022
* Around February 2024, broke above downtrend line that started 3+ years ago
* Made a Higher-High around Mar-Apr 2024
* Been on downtrend since April 2024 until it found support around 84s in early August 2024
* Made a Higher-Low around 84s in early August 2024
* Last weeks candle broke the downtrend that started in April 2024
* Classic Inverse Heads & Shoulders pattern
   * Head (bottom) around 79s (in Oct'2023), and shoulders (lower-low and higher low) around 84s
   * Took about 10 months from LL in Dec'2022 to bottom in Oct'2023
   * Took about 10 months from bottom in Oct'2023 to Higher-Low in August'2024
   * In next 10 months, take out the previous Higher-High of 124s to make a new Higher-High for uptrend.

**Strike price and expiration**

* Why 100C or 120C?
   * Previous higher-high was around 124s made in April 2024
   * Don't go regard mode and buy 200C, instead target for realistic 100 or 120C, which is more likely to hit
   * 160C by June is a better regard mode strike price - can be a 10 bagger or more
   * 100C is psych number and will provide better liquidity
* Expiration - Why June'2025?
   * Cyclic patterns - took about 10months for last LL to bottom, and from bottom to HL.
   * 10 months from now is about May'2025
   * You can go regard mode and buy expiration for Dec'2024 or early 2025
   * Or play safe and buy June'2025 expiration for better liquidity

Extra crayons logic: MACD on weekly is just about to cross for uptrend.

Joby Aviation: Flying Cars and Flying Too Close to the Sun,"Ever since The Jetsons, people have dreamed of flying cars. Now, thanks to advances in electric motors and battery technology, we're finally on making them real. But the path from science fiction to viable business is rarely straightforward, and the emerging eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) industry faces some interesting challenges.

# The Opportunity

The potential market for eVTOLs is enormous. Morgan Stanley estimates it could reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. That's the kind of number that makes investors' eyes light up. But as any experienced founder knows, a big potential market is just the beginning.

What's exciting about eVTOLs is that they represent a genuinely new category of transportation. They're not just incrementally better helicopters or planes - they're a fundamentally different way of moving people and goods. This creates opportunities not just for the companies building the aircraft, but for an entire ecosystem of supporting businesses: vertiports, air traffic control systems, maintenance services, and so on.

# Market Overview

The eVTOL landscape can be broadly categorized by product, application, and operation. From the simplest helicopter-like configuration to the more advanced tandem tilt-wing architecture, these designs are based on both innovation and market considerations. 

Pivotal's BlackFly, for example, is the first eVTOL aircraft to be both commercially sold and delivered to an individual.

* Its unique tandem wing architecture offers several key advantages including reduced manufacturing cost, fewer potential failure points, and fewer design complications, especially relative to tilting-rotor configurations.
* Its ease of transport and launch-30 minutes to be deployed via 16-foot trailers - and its triple modular redundancy to prevent failure have garnered it interest from the US military as well.
* While its cost of $190,000 is much higher than even a premium car, it does come in at a lower price than certain small aircraft.
* However, as this industry is primarily focused on carrying multiple passengers, the lack of scale and smaller capacity per craft will always limit it's total market share.



# Industry Landscape and Competitive Analysis

Key players in eVTOL market can be categorized as follows:

Pure-play eVTOL companies:

* Joby Aviation
* Lilium
* Archer Aviation
* Volocopter
* Pivotal

Traditional aerospace companies:

* Airbus (CityAirbus)
* Boeing (partnership with Wisk Aero)
* Embraer (Eve Air Mobility)

Automotive and technology companies:

* Hyundai (Supernal)
* Toyota (investment in Joby)
* Intel (investment in Volocopter)

While Pivotal and others have targeted the individual consumer by emphasizing aircraft like the BlackFly, a substantial portion of the industry is concentrating on manufacturing aircraft designed for urban air taxi services, which we'll dive into in the next section One of the most prominent players in this space is Joby Aviation.

# Joby Aviation: A Pioneer Facing Headwinds

Emerged as a frontrunner in the eVTOL race, becoming the first company in the sector to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger. Initial investor hype propelled its stock to over $14 per share, reflecting some reddit and legit excitement in the nascent industry. The company, founded by JoeBen Bevirt, has spent years developing its eVTOL aircraft, securing partnerships with industry giants like Toyota, and making significant progress toward FAA certification.

However, cracks started appearing in Joby's narrative. The company's early financials were marked by heavy R&D expenditures and substantial operating losses. Moreover, Joby's marketing efforts seemed to outpace its technological development, as seen in costly Super Bowl ad spots while still generating very low revenue. CEO Bevirt's grand pronouncements – envisioning Joby as the **""FedEx, Southwest, and Tesla of flight""** appeared detached from the company’s product focus, raising concerns about a diluted vision and unrealistic expectations. Savvy investors recognizing these warning signs began shorting the stock, further contributing to its decline, trading at $5 per share, which is less than one-third its original valuation, as of 2024.

# Dissecting Financials and Technology

* **Technology**: Joby's eVTOL utilizes a unique tilt-rotor configuration, allowing for vertical take-off and landing while transitioning to efficient forward flight. This design combines the benefits of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, optimizing both maneuverability and speed. The aircraft's electric propulsion system offers environmental advantages, reducing noise and emissions.
* **Funding and Development**: Joby's journey has been marked by substantial funding, including investments from likes of Toyota Motor Corporation and Intel Capital. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger in 2021, raising significant capital to further its development efforts.  However, despite these significant investments, Joby has faced challenges in meeting its initial timelines and achieving profitability, primarily due to high R&D and testing costs. As of 25 September 2024, Joby's market capitalization stands at approximately $3.69B (down from $6.6B - valuation at IPO), reflecting investor uncertainty about the company's long-term prospects.
* **Strategic Partnerships**: Joby has forged key strategic partnerships, including a collaboration with Delta Air Lines to integrate eVTOL services into Delta's existing transportation network. This partnership aims to provide seamless connectivity for passengers, expanding the reach and accessibility of Joby's UAM network. Joby has also partnered with Uber to integrate its air taxi services into Uber’s ride-hailing platform.
* **Challenges and Opportunities**: Joby faces similar challenges to other eVTOL developers, including regulatory hurdles, infrastructure development, and public acceptance. However, the company's strong financial backing, strategic partnerships, and focus on commercialization position it as a significant player in the evolving UAM market.
* **Market Demand and Performance**: The broader market for urban air mobility is still in its nascent stages, with commercial operations yet to commence on a significant scale. However, the increasing interest from established players like Delta, Uber and Joby, along with rising consumer demand for faster and more convenient transportation options, suggests a substantial growth trajectory for the industry in the coming years.

# Challenges and Lesson Learned:

The eVTOL industry's primary challenges extend beyond the issues faced by individual companies like Joby.  The sector must navigate several key hurdles to achieve widespread adoption and profitability.

* **Regulatory Frameworks:**  Establishing clear and consistent regulations for eVTOL operations, including air traffic management, certification standards, and pilot licensing, is crucial for ensuring safety and fostering investor confidence.
* **Public Acceptance**: Addressing public concerns about noise, safety, and privacy is crucial for gaining the social license to operate and fostering widespread adoption of eVTOL services.
* **Economic Viability**: Achieving profitability for eVTOL operations will require careful management of costs, including aircraft manufacturing, maintenance, and operating expenses.  Pricing strategies must also balance affordability for consumers with the need to generate sufficient returns for investors.
* **The Value of Strategic Partnerships**: Joby's collaboration with Delta and Uber underscores the importance of strategic partnerships in navigating the complexities of a new industry like UAM.  Collaborating with established players can provide access to resources, expertise, and existing customer bases, accelerating market penetration and adoption
* **The Importance of a Realistic Vision**:  Joby's overly ambitious initial vision, attempting to be everything to everyone, highlights the need for a realistic and focused approach to market entry.  Concentrating on specific use cases and target markets can enhance the likelihood of success in a competitive landscape.

# Investment Considerations and Valuation Approaches

Given the pre-revenue nature of most eVTOL companies, traditional valuation metrics are of limited use. Investors should consider:

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**:

* Projecting future cash flows based on market size estimates and company-specific factors
* High discount rates to account for technology and market risks

**Real Options Valuation**:

* Accounting for the value of strategic flexibility in an uncertain market

**Comparable Company Analysis**:

* Utilizing metrics from adjacent industries (e.g., electric vehicles, aerospace)
* Key metrics: EV/Total Addressable Market, Price-to-Book

**Milestone-based Valuation**:

* Assigning value to achievement of key technical and regulatory milestones

# My Long View

Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic about the future of eVTOLs. The potential benefits in terms of reduced traffic congestion, faster emergency response times, and new transportation options for underserved areas are too significant to ignore.

But it's going to take time. The winners in this space will be the companies that can combine technical innovation with business acumen and regulatory savvy. They'll need the patience to navigate a long and complex development process, and the flexibility to adapt their strategies as the market evolves.",12,1727251514.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1foz8ak/joby_aviation_flying_cars_and_flying_too_close_to/

ZETA $180K YOLO,"Sharing an opportunity to make some money on a small cap AI play in ad tech software. 

Zeta Global (ZETA) is a SaaS software company that sells access to their marketing database to large businesses for targeted marketing. This database has over 240M individuals, and that’s just in the USA alone. That’s pretty much the entire population, so chances are that your name is in this database, and the company is profiting off you. Their revenue will be over $930M this year (growing 27%), and they have over 144 large customers that spend over $1M per year on ZETA. Market cap is only around $7B. 

Zeta is up +240% this year, and just hit an all time high at $30. This is mainly because their revenue growth rate has accelerated from low 20% range to high 20% range. They use AI to optimize the marketing engine and serve up the perfect ad to the target consumer, so this is the rare case of AI actually driving additional revenue. At the same time, their profitability / EBITDA is also expanding. The stock has been on a steady climb up for the last 6 months, coinciding with 2 great earnings reports for Q1 and Q2. 

You are probably thinking “congrats, this js a nice run, but it can’t continue”. Not the case, this company has quietly dropped a few press releases recently that hints of something massive in the works. Keep in mind this is a small cap tech company at under $7B value, so they don’t get a ton of attention due to all the magnificent 7 hype. I think that the Q3 call is going to be even better than Q1 and Q2, for the following reasons. 

1. Upward revision of guidance in quarter. The company is a solid beat and raise machine, but on 9/4, they raised guidance again (a quiet press release without much fanfare). They raised guidance from 27% growth to 35%. This is unprecedented and a very bullish move. https://investors.zetaglobal.com/news/news-details/2024/Zeta-Increases-3Q24-Guidance/default.aspx
2. Debt refinance at a lower interest rate, with more access to capital if they need it. Now they have access to an additional $350M in cash to do something big. https://investors.zetaglobal.com/news/news-details/2024/Zeta-Announces-Successful-Completion-of-Debt-Refinancing/default.aspx
3. Additional stock offering on 9/4, which raised an additional $200M. Price was at $23.50, and stock has been on a run since then. https://investors.zetaglobal.com/news/news-details/2024/Zeta-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Class-A-Common-Stock/default.aspx

Earnings will happen late October. I’m expecting a massive blowout of earnings (even above the mid quarter raise), and then also a big announcement of some kind. They are sitting on a massive pile of cash, and it’s obvious they are about to do something with it. They have hinted at M&A in the past, and now they are ready to execute. A previous investor day deck provides some guidelines of what they are looking for (sustainable growth with accretive profitability). Assuming they follow their M&A playbook, the stock will keep ripping. 

I’m long 6K shares and am expecting another big pop in a few weeks. Haven’t yet bought calls, but am looking at pricing because something is definitely brewing. 

TL/DR - I have a massive stake in ZETA because I believe they are going to crush Q3 revised guidance, and will continue the trajectory for the rest of the year. They raised a ton of cash and business is accelerating faster than they can forecast it. Bought shares (not calls) because I feel confident in the long term.

1929 Crash vs. Now,"Took an edible and justed started doing my thing googling finance/economic stuff. Just wanted to correlate the 1929 crash and what's going on now. Granted what I think isn't as extreme as the '29 crash, but I think it's noteworthy. In early August this year the market dipped like 3% two days in a row and people were freaking out. I learned it's cause folks were borrowing Yen cause of the Yen's low interest rate and then borrowing stocks. The Yen's interest rate was raised a quarter of a point I think and then everyone involved in this game got scared and sold. It rang a bell in my brain when I just read these couple sentences from an article from '29 crash. Granted the '29 crash was due to dumber borrowing, but I think there is some correlation. Couple sentence excerpt below. Just put this here to let you guys poke holes in it and shoot the breeze.

""Purchasers put down a fraction of the price, typically 10 percent, and borrowed the rest. The stocks that they bought served as collateral for the loan. Borrowed money poured into equity markets, and stock prices soared.""

Iron Condor Hedging Delta,"Hey guys, i want to know about the concept of put skew and smirk / smile concept. Generally puts demand higher premium than calls, in this case if we want to hedge our position in iron condor - Straddle + Wings. So suppose spy trades at 550 with straddle at (1.25+1.31 = 2.56). So if we want to hedge this position by going 5 strike wide we see puts hedge of 545 at 20 cents and call at 4-5 cents or maybe 7-8 cents max. So even at same distance, we see puts demanding higher premium than calls in hedging this position. TastyTrade did some research on this topic, i wanted to know if we should hedge our position at similar premiums or similar distance?? Suppose 540 puts trade at 7 cents and 555 calls trade at 7 cents too so should we hedge this position where distance of puts is 10 strike and calls is 5 strike. Or for Iron condor the distance from the sold wings should be similar and we should pay a higher premium for hedging puts. Any views on this?? I am not able to find the video tasty did on this.

Market Musings,"In my work, I’ve observed a clear trend among institutional capital allocators, such as pension funds and endowments, moving away from active public equity investing. Data shows that about 40% of current market flows are passive. When we pair this with the fact that an active active managers does not outperform the market, the strategy to buy low cost beta to get market exposure makes sense. In such a scenario, the business model that wins within public equities’ is the one that uses the liquidity that public markets provide and maps it with a differentiated risk-reward curve to passive investing. Hence the natural winners will be market neutral hedge funds - especially the platforms where risk parameters are tight and high quality alpha is being leveraged to generate solid risk adjusted returns. Positive returns through different market structures with Sharpe over 1.5 means these large platforms would continue to be in demand. The worry is they will run out of capacity at some point, but with a market neutral strategy, the world is their oyster and they can scale across global markets whilst defining the right capacity in each of these markets.

From a retail perspective, if institutional stock pickers have less than a 15% chance of beating the market, your odds are even slimmer. My strongest advice for anyone around 25 is this: **Start saving early and invest passively.** Aim to save at least 20% of your income each year and invest in low-cost index funds. By the time you’re 50, you’ll likely accumulate far more wealth than if you tried to pick stocks on your own and realized by 35 or 40 that passive investing was the way to go. You can always allocate a small portion of your savings for personal investing as a learning tool, but prioritize a predominantly passive approach.",7,1727228364.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fot4m6/market_musings/

I believe that the US Labor market and US consumer are currently much weaker than what is being indicated by the media/FEDs at this time. Interest rates are going to fall very rapidly over the next year in attempt to prop up the labor market, and influence greater consumer credit spending. I do not believe this will work because of the present state of the average US consumer. Lowering interest rates can't help consumers who already don't have any sheckles.

The American consumer is completely broke and over levered, and additionally we are trending towards a tightening labor market, as corporations have been laying off more frequently due to over hiring during the pandemic, job openings are trending down, and unemployment is on the rise. I believe in the next 12-24 months we are going to bear witness to a Consumer Led Recession. For those of you that have made it this far, allow me to explain with some graphs.

**Saving Rates**  
""Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences""

US savings rates are at the same levels we experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, currently last reported at 2.9%. This means the American consumer has only been able to save 2.9% of their earnings towards their retirement, or to buy houses. In the second graph we can see this is trending downwards even still since COVID, as wages have not kept up with the high levels of inflation.

**YoY Household Expenditure**

Year-over-year household expenditures have up-ticked dramatically since the COVID bucks were printed. The average increase YoY change in Household Expenditures has historically been 3.074% since 1984 (close the average inflation rate in the US of 3.25% since 1973). The problem here arises in the second picture below. Household expenditures rose by 8.361% in 2021 and 8.276% in 2022, which is back-to-back years outside of 1 standard deviation away from the mean, highlighted as 5.693%. Tomorrow at 10:00 AM the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release their 2023 Household Expenditures data, it would not be shocking that 2023 was another above-average year, as the average inflation rate for that year was 4.1%.

**Delinquency Rates Consumer Loans**

Here's where we get interesting again, Consumer Loan Delinquency rates are now currently above levels in 2011 and have continued to trend upwards in our heightened interest rate environment. This may infer two things: consumers have not changed their spending habits, or have become over levered. Orange line indicates the average since 1987.

**Delinquency Rates Credit Cards**

Delinquency rates on Credit cards are saying the exact same thing as consumer loans. Trending upwards, and above levels since 2011 in the era of low interest rates and lessened inflation.  
What I WILL say is that delinquencies on mortgages have not risen much, but that is an indicator than I am aggressively watching QoQ.

**US Deposits**

Deposits on checking, time and savings accounts for households are all going down and are currently all **BELOW** levels in 2019. This is indicating that consumers are currently being forced to draw on their savings previously established from the pandemic to survive, or keep up with their perceived levels of consumer spending. This is also inline with what you can hear from retailers, like Amazon, Walmart or fast-food businesses. Customers are becoming more ""value-orientated"", as they look for ways for their dollars to go further. [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html) is a great read from multiple earnings calls that highlight this.

All data I've presented is publicly available from the US FED or BLS. DYOD.

tl;dr US Consumer is broke. GDP may continue to grow but at a snails pace since consumers have no money to spend lavishly. Savings are going down and delinquencies are going up. Large credit risk, liquidity risks, and geopolitical risks are present.

The Time Has Come For Archer Aviation ACHR - eVTOL will be in operational to military by 2025 and commercially by 2026,"Archer innovation is down 47.68% YTD and down 81% from ATH. However, flying air taxis and autonomous air-robotaxis are closer than ever. In August AA delivered its first aircraft, ""Midnight"" to the U.S. Air Force for trials and tests.

They have completed 400 test flights in 2024 with 402 test flights already completed.

The successful test flight included an inflight transition, where the Midnight performed a vertical take-off before accelerating forward with its wing-borne capabilities and landing vertically again.

>*A transition flight occurs when the aircraft takes off vertically like a helicopter, accelerates forward, transitions from thrust-borne to wing-borne flight like an airplane with tilt propellers forward before decelerating and landing vertically.*

https://preview.redd.it/2hg3w0j2duqd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf250c593cd5439e21b640a65df1871b76b5100a

So what is so great about an eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) vehicles?

* Reduced air and noise pollution: Zero direct emissions
* Sustainable transportation
* Taxis service: Currently sits 4 and a pilot with future models allowing for more passengers
* Emergency medical services such as medical evacuation and emergency medical deliveries

Highlights of AA eVTOL 1st generation aircraft:

* Vertical take off/landing and forward wing wing-borne flight
* Can reach speeds of 150 mph and have a range of 100 miles
* 100x quieter than a helicopter
* Costs 1/3 of the cost to manufacture and operate than a traditional helicopter
* Carries a 1000 pound payload
* Will manufacture 10 aircraft in 2025 and 650 in 2028
* Air Mobility network in Los Angeles set to operate in 2026 for an UBER like flight ride booking service
* United Airlines and Stellantis are collaborating partners injecting $400 million into its operational capabilities.
* Contracts and collaborations with NASA on battery cells performance and improvement for advanced air mobility
* Reported memorandum of understanding puts AA's pre-order book at \~$6 Billion of revenue 

In fact, N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million.

The best part is there is a massive short interest % of 22.28% as last reported to Nasdaq. The companies ATL is $1.87 & $2.00 a share in 2023. Unless you are believing this company is going bankrupt I can't imagine seeing lows to that level again but it is possible.

Current investment headwinds are also seeking to alleviate with the new FED posture towards the FFR from ""restrictive"" to ""recalibrate"".

Lastly, I like the potential and promise of this new technology. If the price is right and they can find ways to keep the travel cost low I can see the feasibility of taking a group such as a family on a trip using this instead of purchasing an expensive flight and dealing with the airports.

The cons to all of this new Jetsons type of technology will be regulatory hurdles but proving this out with the military and NASA is surely to get them a quality working framework for more and more general use.

Even though regulatory concerns are a con they have a sort of bonus bright side that is worth considering. Air-Robotaxis. Controlling an aircraft autonomously is much much easier than trying to control a vehicle autonomously. The rules in the air are well established and there is significantly less congested by orders of magnitude. It wouldn't surprise me if we have these vehicles autonomous before we have level 4/5 self-driving vehicles.

All in all I think now is the time to invest in the premier eVTOL startup Archer Aviation.

"FBI Raids Carahsoft Office—What’s Going on with VMware, Broadcom, and National Security?","Hey everyone, something huge went down today, and I wanted to share what I know so far. Some who I know works at Carahsoft in Virginia, and earlier today, the office was raided by around 50-100 FBI agents along with other federal agencies. They confiscated everything from laptops, desktops, and even personal journals, leaving everyone pretty shocked.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what happened:

* **Date**: September 24, 2024 (Today)
* **Location**: Carahsoft office in Virginia
* **What happened**: Employees experienced a weird VMware update across all work laptops. Not long after, FBI agents stormed the building instantly yelling they have a ""Search Warrant"", took equipment, laptops, desktops, even journals and pencils lol, and started questioning employees about the team managing VMware software (who, interestingly, work remotely from places like Hawaii). Tuesdays are their days where most people go in person, the feds did not detain, ask to not talk or read miranda rights etc to the person I know at all. 
* **Agents** were especially interested in the company’s data servers located on the 4th and 5th floors of the building.
* **Aftermath**: Employees were told they probably won’t get their equipment laptops etc back anytime soon.
* The company is giving everyone new laptops tomorrow so far this is quitet but should come out in public and officially soon.

# Why Does This Matter?

VMware, a major player in cloud computing and virtualization, was recently acquired by **Broadcom** (December 2023), and they hold **very sensitive data** for many industries, including government agencies and national security bodies. Here are some major developments related to VMware and Broadcom over the last year:

* [**Broadcom Completes VMware Acquisition**](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2023/12/13/insights-broadcom-completes-vmware-acquisition-software-business-expected-to-account-for-40-45-of-its-revenue/): This acquisition was a big deal. VMware now dominates the server virtualization market, with more than 70% market share.
* [**VMware Settles $84.5M Patent Lawsuit**](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/vmware-settles-patent-lawsuit-after-densifys-845-mln-trial-win-2024-05-13/): VMware recently settled a lawsuit where they were accused of infringing on cloud software patents. It’s a huge case that hints at legal and ethical issues surrounding VMware’s practices.
* [**AT&T Sues Broadcom Over VMware**](https://www.fudzilla.com/news/59652-at-t-sues-broadcom-over-vmware-s-extended-support): AT&T is suing Broadcom because Broadcom is refusing to honor VMware support contracts unless AT&T purchases additional (and unneeded) subscription services. AT&T argues this puts national security at risk as many government services rely on VMware’s software.

# What Could Be Happening?

The raid could be tied to VMware’s role in managing sensitive data for **U.S. federal agencies**, including national security bodies. With all the legal drama surrounding VMware—like the lawsuit with AT&T—it’s possible that VMware’s data handling or licensing practices raised red flags with the federal government.

Also, the fact that VMware is integrated into so many critical systems across industries (including **national security** and **first responder systems**) makes this raid potentially more than just a corporate dispute. There could be concerns about **data security breaches**, **corporate espionage**, or even VMware’s legal battles coming to a head.

# Key Takeaways:

* VMware is involved in **critical U.S. government services** and national security infrastructure.
* There’s a growing tension between Broadcom and major companies like AT&T over VMware support, which might put public safety at risk.
* The raid could be part of a much bigger issue involving **national security** and **corporate malfeasance**.

Keep an eye on this story—it’s not getting national coverage yet, but given the scale of the raid and what’s at stake, it might soon hit the news in a big way.

What exactly should we do after a big YOLO Gain?,"I've heard stories of people ending up with a huge tax bill surprise, but they made no money because they lost all of it right after.

For example someone goes all in on AAPL Calls, makes $100,000 in one day with a risky 0DTE Bet, Then the very next week gambles and loses all of the $100,000 in AAPL Calls.

Apparently the loss was a wash sale, and those can't be used to reduce taxable gains, the loss is not eliminated but deferred.

So what if he actually waited the whole 31 days then he lost it all, would he not owe any taxes then? I'm kinda confused by this wash sale rule.",4,1727212941.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fons5w/what_exactly_should_we_do_after_a_big_yolo_gain/

"RIVN vs. TSLA - Rivian Target - $45+, Tesla ? ","Rivian has a market value currently around 12B –  right under 12/sh, and could easily double from here and further be worth $45+ over the next couple years as deliveries increase – it's an early Tesla play, with growing momentum in their production and excitement for their pipeline. 

It trades at a fraction of the valuation metrics Tesla does in every sense, but Rivian has an exciting pipeline coming and is the shiny new product non-EV and EV owners alike are excited for. 

Compared to Tesla’s delays and pushing off robots and everything else, Rivian is actively growing and has a great pipeline over the next 2 years.   
   
**Bear case** –  

Rivian is burning too much money, and losing on every vehicle sold, and will ***FAIL*** –  

Burning money is not sustainable, and I agree. *But will it actually fail*?   
   
They are still early in ramp with higher production costs, but building more of a car than Tesla offers and working with less subsidies than Tesla originally had. Yet, they have key production growth, and are prepped for the acceleration of their product demand with both commercial vehicles and consumer vehicles.  

**Factory Upgrades and Focus on Margin**

Rivian has guided towards seeing better margins this fall, in part from the re-tooling seen this last May. [Normal Site Retooling](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/rivian-completes-plant-retooling-pivotal-to-profitability/715673/) 

They are continuing to invest in their site, with approved plans to build out a larger space and prepare for R2 production, both of these upgrades leading to over 215,000 units of capacity across the R1 / R2 / Commercial platforms they offer. [R2 Site Expansion](https://electrek.co/2024/08/20/rivian-rivn-approved-major-plant-expansion-r2/#:~:text=Rivian%20gets%20the%20green%20light%20for%20massive%20plant%20expansion&text=The%20amendments%20to%20its%20site,ft%2C%20or%20roughly%205%25) 

Further, the VW Partnership further mentioned below has already brought tailwinds and initial cost savings, and will likely further support long term profitability. [VW Partnership Cost Savings](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/rivian-supplier-cost-savings-vw-partnership-earnings-q2/723660/)

**Production Analysis** 

Recently in another group, a user posted their production analysis, and it’s following Tesla’s quite well: [Rivian vs. Tesla Production Ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1f2yk9y/comparing_rivian_and_teslas_production_ramp/?share_id=67dj9Qr_8DjKXpFglZzfQ&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) 

While Rivian is still early, they’ve already shown what the R2 ([R2 / R3 walkthrough with RJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Gt_PUyldc) ) and R3 - ([R3 Design walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoBBibT_IAI)) -  will look like, and people are EXCITED for them to come out in 2026 (R3X potentially fall '26 or later).  

While we see headwinds in the EV industry, as time goes on EV infrastructure will continue to increase, furthering EV adoption (including Rivian).  It doesn't seem like Tesla will be the only pure-play EV company to survive.

So who is buying Rivians currently?  

Tesla owners, among others. More Rivians are being sold, and they are starting to be a choice among Subaru owners (a sticky owner usually), Tesla owners trading up, and even first time EV owners. Plenty of people from EVs to ICE vehicles are trading up and into Rivians, and are loving them!  

It makes sense the love for Rivian current owners have – it is a beautifully designed vehicle around the user, made with intelligent features people love to use from adventuring to everyday driving. 

Importantly, it’s also built around the technological architecture of the vehicle. Instead of other vehicles with 100 different computers that don’t talk well with each other, Rivian is building each platform as a tech-first platform, which is why VW – who has struggled with their own software and advancing tech internally – has partnered with Rivian, to the tune of $5 Billion when the company was worth $10 Billion.   
   
VW still has $4B more to invest in Rivian, so adding that to the $8B in cash they had as of their last earnings report, and Rivian is worth more today and long term. 

**Partnerships** 

Rivian has some large backing, between the Amazon contract they are producing for, and the VW Rivian Partnership. VW is a large player with many brands like Porsche, VW, Audi, and more – but they’ve struggled trying to build better tech internally. For a group seeing headwinds in the industry and China, partnering with Rivian isn’t a risk they would take if they didn’t need to – while the partnership is important for Rivian, it’s incredibly important for VW as well, including the level of due diligence needed for a $5B investment in Rivian. ([VW Struggles with Software](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/07/11/volkswagen-rivian-joint-venture)) Notably, while we talk about Rivian vehicle production and ramp, it's Rivian's tech-first focus and the way they've built a vehicle around the technology which also differentiates them and attracts VW to this deal.

Additionally, while Rivian continues to produce and deliver vans for Amazon, they are now also able to sell similar vans to other companies. While Amazon was the first, this adds to the moat Rivian is working to develop that defends their positioning – commercial EV sale -.[Rivian Commercial Vans](https://rivian.com/fleet). As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, Rivian is well positioned to take market share in the commercial space as well as consumer space. 

**Team** 

While Tesla has a crazy cult following, combined with Elon Musk’s cult following, RJ is similarly an engineer at heart but is a down to earth guy that also has a PH.D. from MIT. His exec team has experience across the auto landscape, having experience previously at Tesla, Chrysler, Volvo, Stellantis, and Jeep, as well as Apple, JPM, and more. His team is experienced across different facets of the industry, and brings both a tech focus with auto experience into Rivian's design, production, and overall customer focus.

**Summary**

EVs have plenty of headwinds, but considering how much existing customers love the product, the excitement for what is coming for the brand, the cash on hand and backing from VW, the commercial vehicle side, and overall positioning, I think the risk is worth the significant upside Rivian is positioned for.

"Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis. What do you think about the company?","Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis  (i dont own any shares of clear)

  

Is a biometric security company which means it produces eye and fingerprint scanners but clear secure markets them skillfully. At airports there are extra clear booths where you can confirm your identity via scanner if you have a clear plus membership and thus skip the line for normal government identity confirmation at the airport.  

  

Clear secure benefits:  

  

Clear secure benefits from unorganized airports by offering a short queue with which you can get identified by eye scan and thus do not have to wait the normal often long waiting time.   

  

Identity checks at airports are already overloaded with queues sometimes hours long and every year more people will travel and fly so it may be worthwhile for people who travel often to buy a Clear plus membership.  

  

So far, clear scanners are only available at 60 airports in the US, so they have a long way to go to expand  

  

Even though their offer is very expensive (199 dollars per year) and only worth it for people who fly 5 times or more per year, you can get it cheaper with credit cards or other offers, for example with tsa precheck in the offer.   

  

clear secure is also partnering with tsa precheck so in the future they can also take over the check-in of tsa precheck subscribers on behalf of tsa precheck which can be a good way to market clear plus and also shows a good cooperation between clear secure and the government.  

  

For the airports, clear secure is also a win because it brings in a lot of money and with decreasing parking revenue, the airports can replace other revenue streams that are getting lower.  

  

Their scan technology can also be used in various locations such as stadiums, offices, stands, etc. they have created a kind of ecosystem with the aim that in the future you can identify yourself everywhere with your face via clear secure and confirm your data such as age identity and vaccination status. other possible locations would be healthcare, clubs casinos etc. so far clear is already active in several stadiums and interesting partnerships are perhaps those with LinkedIn at LinkedIn you can log into your account via clear secure scan for a year now. You can also register at home depot locations using clear secure. what is interesting here is the way in which the manegment is introducing clear secure in different areas, which shows how many places you can use clear scan technology  

  

clear's ceo has been ceo since 2010 and she initiated all the things that make clear the company it is today  

  

Another interesting point is that clear secure has no direct competitors in this type of business other companies that also sell biometric security services such as facial iris and fingerprint scans serve the us government for example IDEMIA and Thales Group also help with their scans at border control or help with tsa checks at the airport they sell to the government but only the technology.  

  

while clear secure pioneered a commercialized customer-facing system with purchasable premium memberships and stand-alone queues at the airport.   

  

As for the clear plus membership retention rate, last year in Q2 it was 90% and has dropped to 80% this year due to a price increase. of course i hope that this trend will not continue but i assume that in the future the retention rate will remain between 80-90%.  

  

Price increases are nothing unusual for Clear but since 2010 the price of the clear plus membership has only been increased twice while the product has grown from two extra lines to 60 extra lines. this year clear has also added a perk to the celar plus membership. there are some discounts for third party services through the membership and there is also a free search service that you can call if you realize you have forgotten or lost something at the airport and they will look it up on their own or help you find it. These perks are nothing earth-shattering, but they at least increase the value of your membership  

  

Balance sheet or income statement related:  

  

Since 2019 they have tripled the revenue from 192 million to 697 million even if I don't expect such a rapid growth Clear can still grow for many years with an annual growth rate of 10-20% as they still have many easy expansion opportunities and their market cap is only 3 billion  

  

Clear has no debt on the balance sheet  

  

  

Clear has a fcf margin of 38% and even though they have issued 2.5% shares this year, 11.5% last year and 7.27% the year before last, now that they are so profitable they want to go other ways and buy back shares. in the earnings call the cfo also said that they are doing this because they want to be shareholder friendly in the long term.  

  

Even if they have done so much equity funding in the last few years, at least their cash flow has grown faster, which is why their fcf per share has grown by an average of 30 percent in the last three years.  

  

Clear secure disadvantages:  

  

One disadvantage that Clear secure definitely has is pricing their premium membership costs 199 dollars per year, if you look at platforms like reddit or trustpilot one reason for the one star rating is that it is expensive and not worth the price.  

  

or normal consumers this is true even if you assume that the average family flies maybe twice a year it is not worth it for them because that 199 dollars is also a larger percentage of their annual income. This definitely limits clear secures customer base to wealthier people who would just do anything at the airport to make it go faster or maybe people who have to fly very often due to their job so their cost per use is so low that it's worth it  

  

Another concern started with a case in 2022 in which a man who wanted to smuggle ammunition despite a false identity tricked such a clear secure scanner, which of course caused the share price to fall sharply and also with a reason: if the machines are not 100% secure, you don't need them. Clear Secure responded quickly with a new system that scans not only the eyes and fingerprints but also the face, assuring clear secure that they are 100% secure even though no major case has happened since then and face scanning is also relatively secure, clear secure is of course now subject to stricter controls and if such a case happens again, clear secure could be punished more severely.  

  

Another threat is that airports could become more efficient so that a costly overhaul line like clear is no longer needed as mentioned earlier many biometric security companies sell their technology to the government and with enough of these scanners equipped the queues should not be that long. Firstly, of course we don't know what the future holds, but airports have always been completely overcrowded during the peak travel times and I don't see that changing  

  

The last and I think also one of the strongest contra points against investing in clear secure is:  

  

in the end, clear secure at airports (their main buisness) is an overtaking rod for those who want to afford it and that is of course a thorn in the side of every people-oriented politician.   

  

airports are financed by tax money and so instead of offering clear secure for the money, they should make the airport more efficient in general. but if an airport earns millions a year from its clear secure line, why should it do that? For the population that can't afford clear secure, that's obviously bad.  

  

In addition, according to some, the state should not hand over its security processes to private companies, but as far as that is concerned, I don't believe that clear secure lines will be abolished by airports in the future either. clear secure works closely with the state programs tsa and tsa precheck, as I said, in the future clear staff will be able to check in tsa precheck members and there are already lines in cooperation with tsa precheck that combine the two advantages so that there is a clear plus + tsa precheck line at several airports.  

  

Voluation:  

  

Clear secure PE ratio is 42 and the P/FCF ratio is 11, this big difference is due to the fact that clear secure has become profitable very quickly in the last few years in terms of free cash flow and the net income margin is not quite there yet while the FCF margin is just at 38% the net income margin is still at 10% stock based compensation is also not really meaningful that it would make such a difference.  

  

In the future, the FCF margin should in any case remain between 40% and 30% and the net income margin should also move up to 30%.  

  

Conclusion  

  

I am actually interested in the company and could also imagine opening a clear secur position in the future, as I expect a long period of sales growth and the risk factors outweigh the positive aspects.

Selling Amazon - Jassy is a failure grasping at a scapegoat,"I'm overweight Amazon but considering selling at least at least half. I don't see innovation and growth coming after Jassy resorted to old school command and control management and has angered the top talent. Contrast Nvidia relies on leadership rather than power and has been able to continue to innovate with flexible work policies. I'm more optimistic moving more money to a company with motivated employees and a leader with a vision for innovation.

Jassy is a failure grasping at a scapegoat. I hope the board sees this soon and replaces him for the sake of shareholders.

  
Update: My investment premise is:

1. Work has evolved. CEOs who spend resources such as time and energy attempting to run time backwards will eventually hurt profits.

Fastly (FSLY) is a good buy at it’s current ~1.9x revenue multiple,"Fastly is growing around 5-10% YoY as per it’s June end Q2 report, with EBITDA margin in the -20% to -30% range, consistent with past few quarters. Compared to SaaS peers growing at a similar pace, FSLY seems a bit undervalued and should probably be trading today in the 3-4x revenue range. 

Plus the CDN space has a pretty huge moat around it. Owning and maintaining a globally distributed server infrastructure is a pretty big barrier to entry in this market. So not a lot of worry about new competitors coming in. Since it’s a combo software/hardware business. 

Based on their current cash burn and cash on the balance sheet, Fastly has at least 5-10 years before they need to raise more funds, assuming they don’t slow the rate of burn (which is very unlikely). So cash runway is super long. 

Within the context of the new rates environment, FSLY market cap should easily jump into the 5-10x revenue multiple range (if not higher) sometime in 2025 if any one or more the following things happen:
1. FSLY hits EBITDA and/or FCF breakeven
2. FSLY has a good quarter and YoY revenue growth jumps back into the 10-20% range, even if only temporarily. 
3. Their attempts to market and publicize new AI modules and features are successful.

Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. ,"TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings.

The potential for a catastrophic banking collapse is real.,"A result of depression era banking was increased regulation. Not only was the FDIC created to insure deposits, but banks were also mandated to hold a certain percentage of deposits in reserve—as opposed to lending out 100% of the deposits. This ensured that banks could remain solvent, and people could access their money in the event of a bank run.

In 2020 due to covid, these deposit reserve requirements were reduced to 0%, spurring banks to take all their reserves and spend them on bonds—previously banks made no interest on deposit reserves. All of this bond buying combined with the trillions of dollars the government was spending on covid shots, ppe loans, and stimulus checks caused tremendous inflation. The federal reserve was forced to raise rates to keep inflation under control.

Unfortunately, when interest rates rise on bonds, the price of the bond falls. So now all these banks are facing historic unrealized losses on the bonds they bought with the money that was previously held as reserves for deposits. The current consensus is that this is not really a problem because banks can just hold until maturity and receive 100% of their investment back.

However, if some situation were to arise such as higher than expected withdrawals, or lower than expected inflows from loan and mortgage payments, they would then be forced to sell their bonds at a loss leading to a banking collapse like we’ve never seen before.",0,1727132869.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fny582/the_potential_for_a_catastrophic_banking_collapse/

I-80 gold (IAUX) trading near all time lows and not even close to tracking the price of gold. Thoughts?,"Hey everyone,  

I’ve been watching I-80 Gold (IAUX), and despite gold's strong performance lately, the stock is trading near its all-time lows. This seems puzzling given their promising assets in Nevada and recent strategic developments. IAUX hasn't been tracking the upward movement of gold prices like some of its peers in the sector, which raises questions about what the market might be missing.

Is this underperformance due to specific operational or execution risks, or is it more about market sentiment and awareness? Are there development or financing concerns holding back investor confidence?

On the flip side, what catalysts could drive IAUX higher? Are we looking at production milestones, exploration results, or perhaps a shift in market sentiment around gold juniors as potential triggers for upside?

They also project a 47% revenue growth and 50% adjusted EBITDA growth for 2024, with a price-to-free cash flow of just 17.4 which feels pretty low for fin-tech.

Nobody will read this title im gay AMZN,"AMZN call or put?

I am very excited for Amazons upcoming QE in October, but at the same time sceptical on which side should I play on. Call or Put?

Why I think call:
✅ UK’s Chancellor announces £8 billion Amazon Web Services investment
✅ Amazon announces record-breaking sales for 2024 Prime Day event which is and isn’t relevant for this upcoming QE since the Prime Day event was in July.
✅ AWS… need I say more

Why I think Puts:
❌ The last QE did relatively good on numbers, except for the expected growth for AWS which drove the stock down on the day after QE report
❌ Nothing in my due diligence stroke attention on exponential growth in AWS except for the UK’s investment which can still not overide the highly anticipated and demanded growth and pressure on AWS
❌ A Huge Rise in Amazon Sellers Fees making it unprofitable to sell for SOME sellers.

Now for the facts which I can’t even decide if it will or will not affect QE’s movement:
🎭 Employees coming back to office from working remotely??????????? People will either quit or productivity will increase. Most likely the first one since most of them are probably in some sort of exotic countries or Islands.
🎭 Skynopy Inks Partnership With Amazon AWS???? Now a Paris-based satellite connectivity startup linking up with Amazon. Can either end up like the recent GTA definitive edition or like citroen cars. In neither scenarios beneficial. 
🎭 White House teams up with Nvidia, Amazon on AI data centre strategy. Yeah ok and what if Biden loses will the other Telected Rpresident Uwill Mcontinue Pto team up? Or will this be money in the drain type of situation 

Just seen my student debt so might be speaking in Monkey but Im still for some reason expecting good results.

Shorting on german automobile industry,"Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election would be another blow to German industry, the Ifo institute said. He estimated that fulfilling his promise of higher import tariffs could reduce German exports to the US by 15%.

The automotive and pharmaceutical industries would be particularly hard hit, where export losses would reach a third.

Trump announced that if re-elected, he would impose an additional 60% tariff on imports from China and a 20% tariff on imports from the rest of the world. German products would therefore be significantly more expensive in the USA.

Moreover, much higher US tariffs on Chinese imports would likely reduce demand for manufactured goods in China, which would also be felt by German exporters.

Context:

The new Ifo study only looked at the expected direct effects of the increase in US tariffs. Possible countermeasures by China and other countries were not included.

US Cannabis Stocks Are About To Explode. ,"Florida Amendment 3, Schedule 3 reclassification, and the SAFE Banking Act are game-changing catalysts that could send the stock prices of cannabis companies like Trulieve and Green Thumb soaring.

	1.	Florida Amendment 3: If Florida legalizes recreational cannabis, it would open a massive new market for companies like Trulieve, already dominating the state’s medical cannabis sector. The shift to recreational sales would unlock huge growth potential, leading to higher revenues, improved margins, and a broader consumer base. With the market expanding significantly, the increased demand and sales would likely drive stock prices higher as investors anticipate substantial revenue growth.
	2.	Schedule 3 Reclassification: Moving cannabis from a Schedule 1 to Schedule 3 drug would be a major breakthrough. This change would lower the tax burden under IRS code 280E, significantly boosting profitability. Cannabis companies have been weighed down by excessive taxes, but reclassification would improve earnings and free up cash for expansion. The resulting boost to financial performance would likely attract more institutional investors, which could push stock prices sharply upward as the cannabis industry becomes more financially appealing.
	3.	SAFE Banking Act: Passage of the SAFE Banking Act would allow Trulieve and Green Thumb to access traditional banking services, reducing their dependence on costly cash operations. Easier access to credit, loans, and capital would lower their cost of doing business and enable faster growth. With improved cash flow management and lower operational risks, these companies would be in a stronger position to scale. As financial stability improves, investor confidence would rise, sending stock prices higher.

In summary, these three catalysts—recreational legalization, reduced taxes, and access to banking—are poised to create a perfect storm of growth opportunities, driving the stock prices of Trulieve and Green Thumb to new heights as their financials improve and investors pile in.",0,1727083624.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fngcxe/us_cannabis_stocks_are_about_to_explode/

Talking about $INTC Takeover Rumors and Apollo Deal,"Let’s talk about the rumors: Qualcomm potentially taking over Intel, and the investment from Apollo. First, the Qualcomm takeover—it’s super unlikely. A takeover is usually either a cash buyout or a merger.

No way Qualcomm goes for a cash buyout. They don’t have that kind of cash lying around, and there’s no chance they’re gonna take on massive debt just to buy Intel. Intel isn’t exactly rolling in profits right now, so taking on that debt would just hurt Qualcomm in the long run with all the interest payments and losses they'd have to deal with from Intel. So yeah, not happening.

A merger seems a bit more possible, but here’s the thing: Qualcomm is already crushing it in AI chips for phones and probably gonna lead the AI PC game too. What do they really get from merging with Intel? The foundry business is the only thing that might attract them, but the price could be steep. Qualcomm would have to deal with Intel’s losses and those from its subsidiaries. Plus, Intel’s board and shareholders wouldn’t agree to a lowball offer. And if Qualcomm offers a premium just for the foundry, I’m not sure their board or shareholders would sign off either.

So yeah, a merger? Not likely. Best case, Qualcomm ends up being a big customer for Intel’s foundry business when they spin it off.

As for the Apollo deal, that seems more legit, but $5 billion isn’t gonna move the needle much for Intel. It might cover one or two quarters of cash burn, but the downside is a likely unsexy valuation and heavy dilution for shareholders. Intel needs the money, so it’ll probably happen, but it’s definitely not great news for shareholders—definitely not the bullish one.

SEC Approves Options Trading on BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT,"The SEC highlighted that this approval would allow investors to hedge their positions on Bitcoin, using the options market to mitigate the inherent volatility of BTC.

Does the Fed's Balance Sheet point the way to a new Bull Market?,"Since the end of the last bull market, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has been gradually shrinking, signalling a tightening cycle in market liquidity. This reduction reflects tighter monetary policy, in line with the Fed's efforts to fight inflation and cool the market.

  
Currently, the Fed's balance sheet is at one of its lowest points since the start of monetary tightening policies. This key indicator may suggest that we have reached a turning point. As we have seen in previous cycles, balance sheet contraction often coincides with the end of a bear market, setting the stage for the next expansionary phase.

Historically, when the Fed begins to implement expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates and injecting liquidity through asset purchases (QE), the balance sheet begins to grow again. This expansion is usually a sign that the Fed is providing support to the economy, which can translate into higher asset prices and the start of a new bull cycle in financial markets.

  
If the balance sheet begins to expand again in the coming months, we could be looking at the start of a new growth cycle in the markets. We have seen this pattern before: the combination of lower rates and an expansion of the Fed's balance sheet may be the trigger for investors to return to risky assets, driving a new bull market.

Conclusion: Watch for Signals As the Fed adopts a more expansionary stance, it is crucial to watch for movements in the balance sheet. If the balance sheet starts to grow, we could be witnessing the start of a new phase of economic growth and market expansion.

Why I believe Palantir ($PLTR) Will Continue to Explode,"This post is going to highlight the reasons I believe PLTR has the potential to keep its current momentum by focusing on some financials. I've been watching this company for a few years now and they continue to impress me. I know a lot of people will say the buy opportunity has passed given the stock is up 165.71% the past year, but I think you're incredibly wrong.

Before we get started, here is my position.

[Yahoo Finance Portfolio Tracker](https://preview.redd.it/oy4ixcbrweqd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fda51980201096fffe0bc1a6475bb8bca39f34f)

Firstly, we are going to view some financials from 12/31/2020 - 12/31/2023. Then we will dive into the two most recent quarters.

**Income Statement** - (All numbers in millions) Year Ending 12/31

Cost of Rev. - $352.55 , $339.40 , $408.54 , $431.11

Gross Profit - $740.13 , $1,202.49 , $1,479.32 , $1,793.91

Net Income - $(1,166.39) , $(520.38) , $(373.71) , $209.83

For the income statement, I'd like to highlight the growth in revenue and gross profit compared to cost of revenue for all 4 years.

**Balance Sheet -** (All numbers in millions)

PLTR has a very healthy balance sheet. Total Asset growth on an annual basis, AVERAGES 16.52% growth compared to Total Liabilities.

The most recent quarters have been awesome for Palantir. Now we will take a look at them and go over some key points.

**Q1 2024:**

* GAAP Net Income of $106 million representing a 17% margin. (6th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability).
* Revenue growth of **21% YoY**, 4% QoQ of $634 million.
* US commercial revenue grew **40% YoY**, 14% QoQ to $150 million.
* US commercial customer count grew **69% YoY**, 19% QoQ to 262 customers.
* Total commercial revenue grew **27% YoY**, 5% QoQ to $299 million.
* Total government revenue grew 16% YoY and 3% QoQ to $335 million.

The commercial growth in my opinion has been the biggest catalyst for Palantir. There has always been a big question if they will be able to expand their operations outside of government contracts, well they sure can. I believe this is mainly due to AIP bootcamps that Palantir introduced late 2023.

**Q2 2024:**

* GAAP Net Income of $134 million, representing a 20% margin.
* Revenue growth of 27% YoY, 7% QoQ to $678 million.
* US commercial revenue growth of 55% YoY, 6% QoQ to $678 million.
* **US commercial customer count grew 83% YoY and 13% QoQ to 295 customers.**
* Total commercial revenue growth of 33% YoY, 3% QoQ to $307 million.
* Total government revenue growth of 23% YoY, 11% QoQ to $371 million.

As you can see, commercial revenue growth is increasing at a ridiculous rate especially in the US. The same can be said for net income. **Net income for Q1 and Q2 in 2024 totals $240 million. Net income for the entire year of 2023 was $210 million.**

Data is the future. Palantir continues to expand their partnerships to leverage their position in the data market.

[Source: Acumen Research and Consulting](https://preview.redd.it/0avmookb5fqd1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=34f8860a9ac58d6ad6af4064cd6e931a3899b848)

Summary - Palantir is in a position to dominate the data analytics market for years to come. They have been able to gain a large portion of commercial business over the last couple of years, while simultaneously expanding their government business. While their revenue grows, they are able to keep a low-cost structure meaning more net income. The same can be seen with their total assets vs total liabilities. As they continue to partner with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, they will simply continue to grow.

My prediction - $PLTR will be at a minimum price of $100 on 9/22/26.

$Costco - a hill to buy on," COST $905 Long Call Calendar Spread: Either I’m Crazy or Vacationing in Bora Bora This Winter

I either truly belong on this sub, or I’ll be sipping cocktails in Bora Bora after this trade. Everyone said not to touch Costco’s earnings because “they just can’t exceed expectations.” So, I thought, why not play with that sentiment?

The Play:

Sell: 9/27 $905 Call (for those who think Costco will blow up after earnings)

Buy: 1/17/25 $905 Call (because Costco is a solid long-term hold)


My Thinking:

I predict Costco will end this week only up around 3% from the current price. I’m not expecting a huge earnings surprise, so I’m selling the short-term call to pocket some premium.

But long-term, I believe Costco will continue to grow, which is why I’m holding the January 2025 call.


If they hit those earnings, I might be in trouble short term, but long term, I think it’s a solid bet.

Thoughts? Am I crazy for doing this?",93,1727019924.0,https://i.redd.it/3noy3c0xsdqd1.jpeg

Debunking the post debunking that markets are going to tank because the Fed started cutting rates myth,"Post I am debunking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fmmrtr/debunking\_the\_markets\_are\_going\_to\_tank\_because/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fmmrtr/debunking_the_markets_are_going_to_tank_because/)

u/fuglysc posted misleading data by Ned Davis Research that didn't even adjust for real returns and preached it as if it's some ""objective truth"". You can't use nominal returns through 1970-1990, because contraction occurred during stagflation as nominal prices increased. It is a straight up embarrassing rookie mistake...

The dataset also included rate cuts that began at the bottom of an already active recession. Naturally the markets goes up once the economy recovers from a recession and valuations are cheap. It's not applicable to the current market as we're currently cutting rates following a market boom, not bust.

When you control for these variables, the data actually suggests that there's usually a bear market after rate cuts following a boom. Although some of those declines are short lived, it's still important to know that they exist, so you don't get caught off guard.

Nov 1966: +14% 12-month performance.

Sep 1969: -28% drawdown in monthly price. -25% 8 months after rate cut. -14% 12-month performance.

Jan 1981: -29% drawdown. -26% 18 months after rate cut. -14% 12-month performance

Aug 1984: +10% 12 month performance.

Apr 1989: -19% drawdown. -10% 18 months after rate cut. +2% 12-month performance.

Jun 1995: +19% 12M performance.

Nov 2000: -42% drawdown. -40% 22 months after rate cut. -15% 12-month performance

Jul 2007: -53% drawdown. -50% 19 months after rate cut. -18% 12-month performance

Jul 2019: -20% drawdown. -14% 9 months after rate cut. +9% 12 month performance.

"Debunking the ""Markets are going to tank because the Fed started cutting rates"" myth","Too many on here are cherry picking instances in history where the markets tanked once the Fed started cutting rates

They use three examples to back up their case...2001 and 2007 and 2019

Talk about cherry picking the worst examples...in 2001, the markets were in the thralls of the dot com bubble bursting...in 2007, the economy was about to implode from the subprime mortgage crisis...and in 2019, trade war tensions and a global economic slowdown were the main reasons for the market's decline...the markets would've tanked whether or not there were rate cuts...the Fed cutting rates was basically an attempt to administer CPR to an ailing economy

I'm usually bearish so don't think I'm wearing rose colored glasses in our current situation...the markets may go down for a variety of reasons from here on out...whether it being overbought or the last week of September being a bad month for stocks or the upcoming election uncertainty

But the objective truth is that the current economy is in nowhere near as bad a shape as it was in the above three time periods people are cherry picking to use as examples

Cherry picking instances where the markets started declining straight after rate cuts by the Fed is lazy and careless fundamental analysis...what about all the other times the markets rose after the Fed started rate cuts?

""Data from Ned Davis Research shows that, historically, stocks perform well in the 12 months following the first rate cut. Since 1974, stocks have been positive 80% of the time, with an average return of 15%.""

Just look at the chart and come to an objective conclusion for yourselves...in most instances, markets were up in as little as three months after the Fed started cutting rates

Is Private Equity a bubble? ,"I came across this white paper from this guy. I really liked it. He talked about PE industry went from 500 billion to 8 trillion in 20 years mainly because of their „financial engineering“ similar to that of mortgage securities in 08. 

He claimed unwinding in imminent and only a matter of time when. 

What do you think? I myself have seen one too many people obsess about this profession recently, especially ex investment bankers. 

 One of the point I really liked from the paper was, PE firms care short term returns but the owner of a business actually cares long term. PE owners have no trouble firing people and raising prices but the owner on the other had do care about jobs pf the people etc. I have heard buffet shit about PE too in the past, saying they are dishonest. 

Now am having confirmation bias or is there a real interesting story underneath?! Plus all the PE firms are at all times high, Ik that doesn’t mean anything but how long can a thing stay bullish?! Forever?!

Why I believe bond ETF $TLT is a great Invesment.,"I believe $TLT is a great investment for the next 3-5+ years. With the current macroeconomic environment, there is a lot of potential here for capital gains. This claim is based on the recent lowering of interest rates. 

I have ALWAYS been bullish on the U.S stock market. Despite that, I have a feeling there will soon be a lot of market turmoil. There is a lot on the table right now regarding the economy and management of foreign policy. Much will need to be decided after the upcoming election.

The data I have gathered from FRED will be charted from 2004 to 2024. The previous years numbers are averaged on a monthly basis to total an annual figure for that year.

[Federal Funds Effective Rate Over 20 Years \(FRED\)](https://preview.redd.it/u44j1c16nvpd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=82feb1c54600205dabbda76813d94d3327e88e21)

As you can see, each time the FFR has been raised within the span of a few years, once rate cuts start, the market plumets. On June 30th, 2004, the FFR was raised from 1.0% to 1.25%. Following this, there was 16 more rate hikes between 2004-2006 resulting in a final rate of 5.25%. On September 18th, 2007, rate cuts started. The initial was -50 bps. Sound familiar? After 9 more sequential rate cuts between 2007-2009, the FFR was .16% for the beginning of 2009.

From the timeframe of rate increases and decreases in 2004-2009, the market was a catastrophe. The same can be seen in the years 2015-2021. On December 17th, 2015, rate hikes started from .25% to 2.16% ending December 20th, 2018. The following year starting in August, rates were once again steadily cut until March 16th, 2021, with an ending rate of nearly zero. From 2021-2024 we have seen rates rise to 5.33% and just yesterday were cut 50 bps. 

TLT 52-week Low/High price during the years mentioned: 

2004 - $83.10 - $89.55

2005 - $89.33 - $96.70

2006 - $84.16 - $91.53

2007 - $85.17 - $94.99

2008 - $90.28 - $119.35

2009 - $89.89 - $105.71

This data represents a 27.20% gain over 5 years. Now for 2015-2020.

2015 - $117.46 - $130.69

2016 - $119.13 - $141.56

2017 - $120.17 - $127.99

2018 - $113.58 - $121.97

2019 - $120.02 - $147.28

2020 - $152 - $171

This data represents a 45.58% gain over 5 years. Now lastly, for 2021-2024.

2021 - $135.45 - $151.59

2022 - $96.11 - $139.87

2023 - $83.58 - $106.46

2024 - $88.82 - $99.01 

We can see a 36.80% loss over 5 years.

For these specific periods, the data concludes a lot of price volatility for TLT seeing swings of +27.20%, +45.58% and -36.80%. Price is highest during rate cut years.

Based on this historical data, there seems to be a pattern within 5 years of rate hikes followed by cuts. Rates raise in the first 2-3 years a substantial amount followed by a substantial decrease in rates the following 2-3 years. The FED has announced the prospect of future cuts in the next 2 years with a target rate of 2.9%. This seems like it is following the trend.

The market yield chart above displays that anything 4.5% and under correlates with an attractive price for TLT compared to what it currently trades at.

It goes without saying that when rates lower, bond prices raise. I have picked this ETF due to the price sensitivity long term bonds experience from rate fluctuations. The fund also has a yield of 3.72% but I am not concerned with that.

To sum up, TLT currently sits at $98.89. If rates can get to the target 2.9%, I expect further upside of a minimum +15.28% resulting in a price of $114. As I mentioned, I believe a lot will unfold in a matter of time and therefore, see the bond market as an excellent play.

The Market Is Topping. Your Next Play?,"It’s pretty evident the market is currently in a topping process. There’s plenty of videos on YouTube explaining that, but I wanted to discuss what your next play is. I’m confident SPY and others will breakout into next week, but we do have important data coming out as well, which could push QQQ to or near ATH, SPY continuing to make new ATHs, and push other stocks near or to ATHs, or can end the rally. 

I plan on doing a short term play on UVIX/UVXY for October. They’re already sitting at all time lows, so premiums are cheap. The most important data will be released next Thursday with jobless claims and then Friday with core PCE YoY. SPY 0DTEs will be the best plays for Thursday and Friday. The reason I say that is because SPY has been doing V shape recoveries for the past 9 days, so it’s predictable at this point. If it opens higher, wait til it hits a wall and buy puts $1/$2 OTM or vice versa.

Edit: The market is in a current bull trend, but a correction is necessary for the markets to reach higher ATHs. Thats what my play is about. If economic data doesn’t support the Feds narrative, we could see the market complete the topping process.

These replies just reminds me how I miss the old days of WSB. You can literally learn as much as you want about the market through YouTube.

PayPal Back From The Dead?,"Paypal was at one point down 83% from it's all time high in 2021. And let's be frank it deserved to come down like every other over-valued tech stock. At one point it was trading at 67 price to free cash flow. Just absurd.



From the huge decline to now, the revenues of PayPal have consistently grown like clock work.



At the beginning of the year their Free cash flow started growing like crazy. And sure, it's already shown up in their price a bit. Maybe this is priced in already.



But I doubt it because it's trading at the lowest multiple it's probably had in its entire history.

The stock appears to be undervalued, even as its revenue continues to climb to all-time highs. With the new CEO focusing on improving operations and reducing stock-based compensation, there seems to be a renewed effort to create shareholder value.



The last point I'll say is that even though their stock has gone up like 30% this year it's still trailing far behind free cashflow growth and Q4 is a big one for payment platforms.

Are rate cuts setting up the perfect comeback for Biotech/Pharma?,"Hi all,

biotech stocks have been getting hit hard, and most of it is thanks to those high interest rates. But with the recent 50-point rate cut, things might finally start turning around. When borrowing money becomes cheaper, biotech companies—especially those smaller ones—can extend their lifeline a bit longer. That’s huge, considering these companies need lots of cash for R&D, clinical trials, and everything in between. A cut in rates could help get innovation and investment flowing again, especially for those mid-cap companies that have struggled to raise funds during this tough time.

but honestly, what really excites me isn’t just the rate cut. AI is where the real magic might happen. We’ve already seen what AI did for tech, and now it’s creeping its way into biotech. AI is helping with drug discovery, clinical trials, and even finding new uses for existing drugs. It’s crazy how AI models are improving early-phase drug discovery success rates, which could mean way more drugs making it through the pipeline. Some reports even say AI might double R&D productivity. That’s not small stuff!

personally, I’ve been riding the wave and recommend focusing on SMID-cap biotech companies (those in the $2-8 billion market cap range) that have at least 1-2 phase 3 assets and a solid 12-18 months of runway. This strategy keeps you in a relatively safer zone, especially in uncertain markets. For those wanting to refine their research, following bio hedge funds with a similar focus is a smart move. They often target the same kinds of companies.

There are a couple of resources I am using to track upcoming biotech catalysts and runway in the FDA calendar shown below by planning around these key events, you can adjust your portfolio before the big moves happen. It’s all about getting in early—don’t just jump in when everyone else does, please don't!

At the end of the day, between the recent rate cuts and AI advancements in life science, I believe biotech is undervalued right now and could be on the cusp of some significant growth over the next few years.

What do you all think? Would love to hear your thoughts.",32,1726846771.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1flf12s/are_rate_cuts_setting_up_the_perfect_comeback_for/

$ZIM’s Second Coming ,"Breaking this down as simple as possible:
A company called ZIM owns a lot of cargo ships in the middle east.

Attacks on ships in Suez Canal have already made shipping expensive, becuase they have to go around horn of africa. 
Dockworkers in US are striking.

This makes shipping costs skyrocket.

ZIM operates on spot market and they charge market rate for shipping (instead of having a contract in place at a fixed price)
Any raise in shipping costs go directly to ZIMs bottom line 🤑


DD: 
""Around 45,000 dockworkers along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are threatening to strike on October 1, which would shut down ports handling about half the nation’s cargo from ships12. The strike is due to stalled negotiations between the parties, with wage increases and limits on port automation being the main points of contention""
""Union negotiators are demanding a 77% hike in wages over six-years, according to analysts, and promises of a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and container ship movements currently used to load and unload freight at the 36 U.S. ports affected by the proposed industrial action.""

The Union has indicated they are not negotiating and all demands must be met.
US Maritime Alliance response: https://x.com/pitbullover55/status/1836483493783568448?t=sljw4rVbEBGd_yq-gFt_Ng&s=08

Biden will not interfere: https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/biden-wont-block-potential-strike-east-coast-ports-administration-official-
says-2024-09-17/ 

Ok so that sets the stage.... 

Earlier this year Houthi Rebels have been firing on cargo ships. These attacks have led to a 79.6 percent drop in drybulk carriers going through the Suez Canal. Per AP News, ""At least 90% of the container ships that had been going through the Suez Canal are now rerouting around the tip of Africa, said Simon Heaney, senior manager of container research for Drewry, a maritime research consultancy.""

These factors have caused rising prices. 
$ZIM's second coming: 
$ZIM is an Israeli company, ""ZIM is the world's 10th largest container ship operator and the leading Middle Eastern operator in terms of ship capacity."" 

They have contracts in place that provide them a fixed rate, which means any float in shipping prices goes directly to their bottom line.  

""Zim has a large fleet of ships using 30% of it for contract freight and 70% for the spot market side so they are poised to take advantage of this trend due to the war in the Middle East."" This means that instead of locking in the price ahead of time for the goods they ship, the price that they charge is indicative of present moment market conditions (i.e. if the price of shipping goes up, they charge more)

This has been looked down upon by investors because it is out of the norm of industry standards, however it may prove extremely beneficial to the company in the coming 10 days: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/citi-sees-challenges-for-zim-downgrades-stock-on-weak-contract-coverage-93CH-3473037

SeptemBEAR 😘,"SeptemBEAR is back! With kissy emojis!

What happened this week?

Puts played nicely, Jpow cried uncle and markets went uppy downy for a few hours before the market decided to do a slooooow incline right after a magical green dildo overnight run. Bull run yes?

No, I don’t think so.

I try to balance between time in market and timing the market. Yesterday I went 4-4 holding NVDA $110c overnight (MAN I wish I went META or QQQ) as well as snagging profits on QQQ, SPY and NFLX puts - yes you read that right. QQQ and SPY were not great and it was clear I made the wrong choice but still made money. NVDA 100% profit NFLX 30%.

From here until the next day that ends in TOBER I am keeping an eye on QQQ and SPY relative to their August close. I am still committed to a Sept close lower than August and yeah you could see 5 more green days before a massive turd but I’ll be swinging puts on these.

Today is OPEX so I am treading lightly, but at some point today I’ll be eyeing Tuesday puts probably $5-8 OTM for both index. Holding over the weekend isn’t my thang so I usually enter those late afternoon.

TL/DR: QQQ and SPY will close Sept lower than they closed August, swing trade puts for easy profit. Fuck your puts not my puts lol 😆 ",0,1726832281.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fl9v0p/septembear/

"Chewy, Inc. Announces Pricing of Offering of Class A Common Stock by Selling Stockholder and Concurrent Repurchase","PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) (“Chewy”), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today the pricing of an underwritten offering of 16,666,667 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, by Buddy Chester Sub LLC (the “Selling Stockholder”), which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (“BC Partners”), Chewy’s largest shareholder, at a price to the public of $30.00 per share (the “Offering”). The Selling Stockholder granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock. Chewy will not sell any shares of its Class A common stock in the Offering and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of Class A common stock being offered by the Selling Stockholder.

In addition, as previously announced, concurrent with the closing of the Offering, Chewy has agreed to purchase from the Selling Stockholder $300 million of Chewy’s Class A common stock at a price per share equal to the per share purchase price to be paid by the underwriter in the Offering specified above (the “Concurrent Repurchase”). The Concurrent Repurchase was approved by a special committee of Chewy’s Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent and disinterested directors not affiliated with BC Partners. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Concurrent Repurchase. The Concurrent Repurchase is being executed separately from the Company’s existing $500 million share repurchase program authorized on May 24, 2024, which will be unaffected by this transaction. The Concurrent Repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the Offering. The Offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the Concurrent Repurchase, but the Concurrent Repurchase is conditioned upon the closing of the Offering.

Prior to the Offering and Concurrent Repurchase, Chewy had approximately 143 million shares of Class A common stock and 275 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding. If the Offering and the Concurrent Repurchase are completed (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock), Chewy will have approximately 160 million shares of Class A common stock and approximately 248 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding. The Offering and Concurrent Repurchase are expected to close by September 23, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

Morgan Stanley is acting as the sole underwriter for the Offering. Chewy has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the Offering. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents Chewy has filed with the SEC for more complete information about Chewy and the Offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, Chewy, any underwriter or dealer participating in the Offering will arrange to send you the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the Offering if you contact Morgan Stanley & Co.

Mercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook

Stuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.

This was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.

Additionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.

Therefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:

Mercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.
Mercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.
Mercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).
Free cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).

If you don't buy ALT - Altimmune - you deserve to be FAT,"Hey everyone,

I’m sure by now all you degens have heard of Mounjaro and Ozempic. Too bad, you might be too poor to afford them given all you can eat is McDonald’s and Wendy’s after blowing all your money on options. But fear not, there’s a play out there that might help you afford those medications, and I feel it’s highly undervalued in the obesity space, which is the hottest space in pharma right now.

So, what are they actually doing?

**Pemvidutide**

Pemvidutide is a drug being developed by Altimmune, targeting obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist has shown significant potential in reducing body weight and improving metabolic health.

Currently, pemvidutide is in the Phase 2b IMPACT trial for MASH, with data expected in the first quarter of 2025. The company is also preparing for an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of pivotal obesity trials. This meeting is expected to happen before Q3 ends, according to their last earnings call.

**Obesity**

Need I say more? This is the hottest space. Novo’s and Lilly’s stocks have gone vertical simply because of Mounjaro and Ozempic. Lilly has gained hundreds of billions of dollars in market share simply because of Mounjaro. It’s not just Americans; the whole world is becoming fatter, and I wouldn’t be surprised if these drugs just become a part of life or at least some sort of New Year’s resolution.

**So why Pemvidutide over so many other molecules in development?**

When compared to other leading obesity drugs like Ozempic (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide), pemvidutide shows several advantages. While Ozempic and Mounjaro are effective in promoting weight loss, pemvidutide has demonstrated better tolerability and a lower rate of lean muscle mass loss. In clinical trials, pemvidutide achieved a mean weight loss of 15.6% at the highest dose, with significant reductions in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL.

This is key: many upcoming molecules will help you shed weight—12%, 15%, 20%—but the good part about this molecule is that the majority of your weight loss is fat and not muscle. This is a HUGE difference pemvidutide has over other drugs. I don’t want to be skinny and weak; I’d rather retain the little muscle mass I have underneath those curls of fat. Current medications result in almost 40% of your weight loss being muscle, whereas they expect it to be less than 25% with pemvidutide.

**Undervalued you say, but why?**

ALT has a market cap of around $550 million. Another company, Viking Therapeutics, which is basically going all in on obesity as well, has a market cap of $7 billion. Roche bought Carmot for $2.7 billion, where they won’t see revenue until 2030. This company is literally a hidden gem in the hottest space in pharma. On good news, a 3x to 8x is not a crazy thought.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

* **Sept 26th**: Shareholder update – can provide updates on the status of partnerships. The company has clearly said that before going to Phase 3, it will look for a partner. I would not rule out a buyout.
* **Meeting with FDA in Q3**: To finalize Phase 3 trial. This could help with the partnerships. The company has said on multiple occasions they expect this in Q3.
* **Phase 2b MASH top-line trial data in Q1 2025**.

Many big pharma companies are looking for plays in obesity. This is pure speculation, but they can be scooped up by one of them. Many CEO's are being asked about this, so yes, they can be an attractive buyout target

**Positions**

* 1,500 shares – as with pharma, always good to hold the majority in shares.
* 100 contracts Jan 2025 10c, which I have at about break-even right now.

**Summary**

Buy ALT or remain fat for life.

**Risks**

It’s pharma; things can crash and burn on bad data. Don’t try to time options too much. Upside can be violent, so even long-dated calls work out okay.

Note: I did use co-pilot to help me with part of this. My english normally sucks balls

Edit: Just to add 31% of the shares are short, not unexpected in a speculative pharma play.

Short term fate of Credit Card companies in light if interest rate cut,"Recently I've been doing well with my shares and call options of credit card companies (Discover, Mastercard, Visa). Interestingly Mastercard and Visa are down today but Discover is up over 5%.

My question is, with interest rates lowered yesterday what is the short term fate of credit card companies. The strongest sense I have is that they will continue to do well as Americans suffer with this ridiculous inflation, but I can also see financial institutions being bearish on them in consideration of lower interest rates. 

Would you proceed to grab call options when the price is right (typically in the money for me), or hold-off a bit and see. Any other insight is welcomed. ",4,1726776022.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fktizy/short_term_fate_of_credit_card_companies_in_light/

Real reason fed cut 0.5,"Labor markets are still strong, just look at the initial claims this morning. Labor market revisions have been pretty bad but who cares about that right? Truly overall conditions are not at all recessionary right now. Yes yes we have a bunch of warning indicators etc firing off, but most businesses are still seeing growth and excellent profits. There was reason to cut 0.25, but 0.5 is more of a panic move no matter how you spin it. So what the heck is the fed so worried about? Why jam the gas here? AI. 

You still here? Okay good lol, thought I lost you at AI. But seriously, that’s why they cut 0.5. AI is not agi, but it is still being used by a ton of office type jobs and businesses to increase efficiency, cut down on menial workloads and generally to just increase productivity. For arguments sake let’s say on average it has increased productivity 15% across the board for businesses that can utilize ai in some fashion. Sick, that’s awesome. Well… not for long. When, not if but when the US next enters a mild recession (which seems pretty likely over the next year or so), what will happen? Will all of these businesses that have just been gifted a juicy increase in productivity just shrug their shoulders and continue to hire people and grow during a recession? Or will they make the easiest call ever and layoff 15% of their staff right out of the gate, because they truly do not need them. The business can continue to produce the same amount of work / productivity with 15% less staff, and that is without pushing people to do more, that’s just trimming the fat. And that’s also assuming workloads stay at current levels and do not decrease during a recession. If they decrease, then more layoffs come.

So, if a lot of businesses are in that boat, a mild recession will = a disproportionately large layoff cycle. It’s a no brainer, every mba in the room is going to be on board with this. And you know what leads a mild recession deeper into a major recession? Large layoffs…. So, bit of an issue here hey?

But wait! There are other jobs! People will just go do those. Or maybe drive an Uber? Tons of driver jobs out there. For now. Driverless vehicle tests are succeeding and creeping into the delivery sector more and more. Those jobs will shrink, that sector will face layoffs too. But… maybe people can get in to construction and home building etc! Tons of work there! Yes that’s true, but as a recession takes hold, and more people lose their jobs, you know what they don’t do? Buy a new house. So, that sector maybe stays stable ish overall, but there will be no job boom there either. Okay but what about ai? I can use ai to make stuff and run my own little super business! Sure some people will find success with that angle, but it’s going to be a fraction of the total numbers that get laid off. The market will be flooded by people using ai to produce some stupid app or service that is likely generic and sub par to what large businesses can offer. Remember, they have ai too. 

Okay… so people ride out the recession, and then companies go back into hiring mode as the recession naturally fades, and we all get back to making the big bucks right?? NO. AI efficiencies are NOT going to decrease. 5 years from now, companies will be able to do more with less. The jobs that get cut in the next recession will not be coming back, period. We are heading into structurally high unemployment. And this, THIS IS WHY THEY CUT 0.5. There is no universal basic income system setup that can handle the permanently high levels of unemployment that are on the horizon. The fed knows this, the literally said they are now focused on the labor market portion of their dual mandate. They have to keep the party going no matter the cost, to buy themselves time to figure out a way to handle what comes next. This is end game, there is a leak in the boat, we are going to sink, so we need to jam the gas and tell everyone to look out the back at the pretty pretty ocean while preparing to hit the shore hard. This is why employment numbers keep getting revised down, they are intentionally fudging the initial data release to keep up the illusion of a strong economy. They have to. 

Will the market crash tomorrow? I mean anything is possible but I doubt it. Big money knows that the fed is pushing the narrative that everything is awesome, and big rate cuts are just because we are all so cool and we deserve it. They know the fed will pull out all of the stops to keep the party going. Big money will bail right before we hit the shore, if they go too soon, they risk tipping off the rest of us that something is wrong. And once we all think something is wrong, we pull back on spending, and that accelerates the coming recession. So party on you crazy bulls, but keep an eye on the shore line, it’s approaching much faster than you think, and it’s going to hurt when we finally crash in to it. But it beats going down with the ship. 

TLDR: just read it lol. Terrible summary = Stocks go up for now, but bad crash type things are coming. ",0,1726762158.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fkolqz/real_reason_fed_cut_05/
BXMT,"BXMT is now back above 20 .. higher than it was before the dividend cut 2 months ago. That is when many sold, and shorted, the stock. Carson Block (well known short-seller) recommended shorting as he predicted a 50% dividend cut. 

Consider this .. a company does not create (or subtract) value by altering its dividend. BXMT decided to retain more of its investors’ capital than before. It used some of this capital to buy back its own stick, well below book value. Book value matters less for say a tech company, but for a “bank” (which is a way to think about BXMT ..it is a lender, not an owner of real estate), book value is a good indication of “true value” unless one believes the book value is not reflecting economic reality. I believe BXMT management has done a good job reflecting economic reality in their book value.

Rumble: Huge Asymmetric Opportunity to the Upside? Multiple Catalysts ,"Here is my second attempt at posting. Rumble stock ownership breakdown: (1) Insiders 62% (2) Dan Bongino 10% (3) Institutions 23%. That comes out to 95% ownership 1,2 and 3. How is it possible that 14 million shares are currently held short and listed as 16% of the float? The math here isn't adding up. Until I realized that the outstanding shares used to calculate float also includes warrants (i.e. call options) that were issued when Rumble went SPAC/IPO that have strike prices of $10 and $17. Given that the stock is currently trading at $5.27, it makes no sense that the warrants should also be calculated in the float size. Anyways, it is clear that there is some funny business (naked shorting a definite) going on here.

As for the business, Rumble web traffic is up nearly 40% year over year and the share price hasn't reflected this bump at all. Also, this is only year 1 that Rumble started monetizing its platform with ads (started in 2024) and also launched a cloud service (started in April). In year 1, they are already on pace to have $100 million in revenue. That's pretty insane for any business. 

For comparison, Redditt has a market cap of $10 billion with a similar small (compared to other platforms like Meta, etc) but very devoted user base like Rumble. I don't see why Rumble couldn't 2-3x its market cap with such a high growth rate and monetization has only just started. For instance, their cloud business has already landed two big names in Hard Rock Hotel and Miami Dolphins only a few months after launching the service.

Thoughts: Given the strange math in the share ownership (likely heavily naked short) and rapidly growing business. I think this is a great risk to reward play. Not to mention that IF Trump were to win, the stock could easily double in a few days. The stock price moves almost in tandem with the election odds for Trump. I'm not going to make a guess at who wins, but it's a 50/50 at this point and the short term upside is huge. ",5,1726723406.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fkdh7a/rumble_huge_asymmetric_opportunity_to_the_upside/

China Equities Could Bottom,"In June of this year, I began building positions in Chinese equities, focusing particularly on undervalued stocks such as Alibaba, AIG, and Geely Auto. I also invested in BYD Auto, primarily driven by thematic considerations.

The recent 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed signals the start of an aggressive easing cycle. This move may help mitigate further depreciation of the RMB and pave the way for stronger monetary and fiscal stimulus in China. The real rates in China have remained particularly high for an economy showing deflationary tendencies. This might be an interesting juncture for Chinese monetary policy to loosen.

I believe the risk-reward profile for Chinese value equities is favorable, especially in the short term, and we could see a strong rally ahead of the US elections.

Why the market sell off after rate cuts? ,"The market was pricing in a rate cut schedule that was more aggressive than what the fed announced. The fed is cutting rates as a return to normalcy, not as if we were teetering on recession/downturn. When Powell spoke there are 2 key moments to focus on. 

1. He was asked if they had known the July jobs data if they would have cut rates and he said “probably.”

2. He said he was less confident in the jobs numbers as they kept getting revised down.

Neither of these would be a problem on their own but he also said he believed the fed was not behind the curve on addressing labor market (contradicting number 1.) And he said the Fed was purely data driven in their response, which begs the question of whether or not they have accurate and up to date data.

Delta Airlines (DAL) DD: Reaffirmation of long position following 2-week bull run,"Since my last DD on Delta Airlines (DAL) 2 weeks ago, DAL has run up by 12%, trading from 42 to 47. During this time, several readers pointed out valid concerns regarding the investment. I am updating my DD after two weeks to reflect developments regarding DAL as well as to address some of the outstanding concerns.  

In this post, I will touch on the following 

* Current news, analyst upgrades, and mid-quarter guidance from Delta 
* Address potential concerns about DAL 
* Further explore Delta’s competitive advantage and market position strength 
* Re-affirm my original price target of 56, representing another 20% upside by EOY 2024, despite the increasing valuation 

 

**Current News and Updated Guidance** 

* While the Fed rate cuts are at the forefront of investors' minds, fuel and oil prices are on the decline, both trends that benefit DAL 
* DAL outlines macro tailwinds in their recent mid-quarter guidance 
   * [Investor Update (q4cdn.com)](https://s2.q4cdn.com/181345880/files/doc_presentations/2024/09/Q3-2024-Investor-Update-vF.pdf) 
   * Fuel cost tailwinds as predicted from my DD 2 weeks ago 
   * No CRWD hangover on bookings 
* Analyst Rating Updates 
   * 7/12 Bernstein maintains outperform on DAL 
   * 7/13 BOA assigns BUY on DAL 
   * 7/17 TD Cowen maintains buy on DAL 
   * 7/17 Evercore gives buy rating on DAL 

**Addressing the main concerns outlined by critics of my previous DD:** 

Main concerns: 

* Airlines industry is too competitive, pressuring margins and limiting return to investors 
* Airlines are capital intensive, using high leverage to sustain their expensive aircraft fleets 
* There has been no fundamental change to Delta’s value proposition and market position 
* Technical Analysis on the long term is unreliable 

Response to concerns: 

Airline industry competition and margins – while the industry has been historically competitive, several key trends are strengthening the industry as a whole: 

* Oil and fuel prices declining, increasing margins 
* Rational supply control and elimination of excess routes by airlines inorganically raising demand 
* Rate cuts and consumer confidence leading to increasing demand from both corporate and leisure 

Capital intensive and high debt – while DAL took on high debt, it is actively making debt repayments and becoming investment grade top priorities 

* DAL’s debt is 94% fixed rate, reducing volatility associated with interest rates 
* DAL already has lower debt ratios than most of its peers 
* Fed rate cut opens the door for potentially favorable interest rate negotiations on debt 

No fundamental change in value proposition – DAL has consistently been an industry leader in terms of operations and reliability 

* Recent surveys and DAL demand demonstrates negligible brand impact from CRWD outage 
* Weakness in LUV and AAL (AAL dropping from S&P 500) further strengthens DAL as the major player in the industry 
* DAL’s leading ROE, ROA, and ROIC (13%) in the industry make it the most reliable choice for gaining exposure to air travel demand 

Technical analysis in the long term is unreliable – while I am not a professional on technical analysis, it certainly helps the thesis 

* Long-term positive technical trends help support the argument that DAL and airline industry is trending up 
* Short term MA outpacing long term 200MA indicates short-term momentum 

 

**Why DAL maintains stronger ROIC, ROA, ROE, and operating margins than its peers** 

* Main thesis – competitive advantage driven by its newer fleet compared to peers 
   * Newer fleet drives its strong brand strength, strong operational reliability, strong operating margins 
* Why newer fleet is a MOAT and hard to imitate 
   * New aircraft supply constraints 
   * High switching costs, debt costs for new aircraft 
* How new fleet drives brand 
   * Brand strength built on operational reliability, experience 
   * Newer planes are easier to maintain, less unexpected issues 
   * Better customer experience on newer planes compared to peers 
* How new fleet drives superior margins 
   * Newer planes are more fuel efficient, lower fuel consumption and costs 
   * Newer planes are less expensive to maintain 
   * Stronger brand, reliability, and experience allows DAL to charge a premium 

**Outlook and Current Positions** 

* I am maintaining my bullish outlook and my price target of 56 by EOY 2024, though now I am even more confident in my forecast

Un-Employment Year End Stays the Same,"The exact same scenario happened in 2007.

We started off with a 50 cut from 5.25% in Sept. '07 and went all the way to 3.50% by January '08. This was due to how fast unemployement was rising. But the FEDs target right now is 3.50% end of 2025.

GDP was the exact same growth rate as today and unemployment was the exact same as well. The only thing we can watch for is if unemployment rises as fast as it did in '07. Mortgage applications are increasing with a ton of people on the sideline ready to purchase homes.

The current layoffs are from companies over-hiring from COVID so they can get back to pre pandemic levels.

Two things to remember as we enter the new era,"1) lower interest rates mean lower discounting of future cash flow -> future growth is worth more in the present 

2) lower interest rates -> more debt available to the rich

Combine these two and you get more money piling into VC, looking for growth. We’re still a long way away from ZIRP, but every bp down will move money in this direction 

Where does that money go? Take a look at the recent YC batches and you’ll see that the majority of it is going and will be going into AI startups.

Basic DD,"One way of determining the fair value of a company is by projecting its free cash flow. NVIDIAs free cash flow stagnated according to August's report, and so did Morningstar's calculated fair value. The federal reserve rate is also inversely proportional to a company's fair value as follows:

Fair value \~  projected free cash flow/(interest rate - growth rate)

  
Without plugging in values for free cash flow we can leave our answer in terms of free cash flow and its units will be those of a familiar multiplier.



Plugging in 5% for interest rate and subtracting 2% for the growth rate yields 1/(0.05 - 0.02) = 1/0.03 = 33

  
What do you know? Its right around the multiplier for SPY.

  
Let's plug in the new interest rate:

  
1/(0.045 - 0.02) = 44

  
Wow! A fifty basis point cut results in a 30% increase in fair value of the overall market.

  
What if we back calculate using NVDIA's multiplier to estimate a terminal growth rate:

  
1/(0.05 - x) = 50

x = 0.030

  
Use this value to calculate post rate cut fair multiplier:

  
1/(0.045 - 0.030) = 66

  
This is also over a 30% increase for the fair value of NVIDIA giving a fair value for NVDA of **152 right now**.

  
I am reiterating my price target of 160 by the end of October for NVDA.

  
God bless America.

Call me Regarded ,"Powell knows that if the S&P falters, Americans wealth will take a huge hit. Consumer confidence and spending will fall, home prices will collapse, and layoffs will be inevitable when the consumer disappears and GDP craters. 

The US economy is tanking, and no one will come to the rescue. China is and has been in a recession for the better part of a year, the eurozone is teetering back and forth, and the US will drag everyone down lower when the sleeping giant loses steam heading into a dark winter. 

This is only the beginning, and who knows how long it may take to work itself out, when there’s no limit to what the Fed and Govt stimulus can do in efforts to delay (reduce the effects of) the inevitable. 

And no, simply because it hasn’t happened yet, doesn’t mean that the odds of it happening are lower. No one knows what the straw will be that breaks the camels backs, but hindsight will be 20/20. Every recession is different, and this next one will dwarf the last. 

A 30% stock/housing market correction at these levels, when everyone is leveraged to the tits with debt would have parts of America looking like Hooverville again. 

So why is everyone acting like we are out of the woods now, when really we’re just in clearing. If you’re nearing retirement and you have a 401k, maybe do yourself a favor and rebalance that portfolio between now and the end of the year. Why wait for another few percent gains, when the odds of a significant hit to your wealth are higher that the odds of gangbuster returns between now and the end of the year.",1,1726694136.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fk3vu1/call_me_regarded/

Why did Bill Ackman buy Nike? Seems like their losing market share to guys like LULU.,"I just caught an analysis on Nike via Daniel Pronk and honestly, I'm just confused. The stock dropped about 53% from its all-time highs, and while its tempting, the underlying issues are a bit concerning. 

key takeaways:

* **Sales Decline**: Nike's revenue is reported to be declining, with a projected drop of around 10% year-over-year for the first quarter. This isn't just a one-time hiccup; their fiscal 2025 is looking rough too, with expected mid-single-digit declines. ([Rev and EPS projections](https://stockunlock.com/stockDetails/NKE/analyst))
* **Market Position**: It was noted that smaller competitors, like Lululemon, are nibbling at Nike's market share. The fashion industry is unpredictable, and you never know which brands will start gaining traction.
* **Valuation Concerns**: With a price-to-free cash flow at 18.4 Does this imply future growth?  

Is there even more market for Nike to capture? Any insight into what Ackman might be thinking?",2,1726691998.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fk31lv/why_did_bill_ackman_buy_nike_seems_like_their/

"The hype is fun but in my regarded opinion, 50bps is NOT a good sign, and it’s not bullish","A 25 bps cut would’ve been bullish as fuck because it would’ve shown that everything in the economy was going to plan. That the FEDs soft landing plan was succeeding.

To me, a 50bps cut, and forecasts of another 50bps cut before the end of the year, and then a total of 100bps cut in 2025, seems more like the FED in total panic mode because they realised they have left it too late and are now attempting to play catch up. The way I look at it, they’ve put all the data together, crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion that the economy is starting to look like it will stagnate and they’re trying by any means possible to reanimate some life into it. 

But will it be enough? I have no fucking idea. Nobody has any idea. The SPY graph today looks like a heartbeat monitor in a hospital scene of a film, clearly no one knows. I’m waiting for the next quarters data. 

- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone up, and/or inflation has gone up, without any notable growth in inflation adjusted consumer spending, I’m selling everything and shorting SPY. Hard landing incoming. 

- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone down, without inflation going up a load, and there hasn’t been any noticeable hit to consumer spending, then it’s soft landing confirmed. All aboard the bull train.

But seriously, until we get a good amount of data indicating how the cut impacts the economy, no one will have an actually accurate idea whether this marks the start of the greatest bull run ever or the mouth of the cave of stagflation. 
 
That being said, I have no fucking idea what I’m doing and when I was 18 I lost big time on the fucking towel stock so probably inverse what I say idk

They will never let the US stock market fail. The only asset that has outperformed inflation time after time has always been the stock market. 

We're already creepin towards stagflation and the only people that gets f*ked are the ones who don't invest. The future of wealth preservation is not savings or CDs or treasuries, get f*ked, it's the stock market. 

We are entering a new phase of the grand US economy and it is the phase of grand dellusion and mass hysteria of inflated wealth.

Why cut 50? What is JPOW hiding?,"One argument for cutting rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, instead of 50 basis points goes like this: The Federal Reserve only makes larger cuts when something is going wrong in the economy or financial system.

And that’s partly true, but it also misses an important point.

Since the Fed began to publicize interest-rate changes in 1994, the central bank has moved from a neutral stance to a cutting stance six times.

The Fed initiated shallow cutting cycles in 1995, 1998, and 2019, each time leading off with a cut of 25 basis points.

The Fed began what would be deeper cutting cycles three times, in early 2001, 2007, and when the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread in March 2020, each time leading with a cut of 50 basis points.

This has led many analysts to conclude that larger cuts of 50 basis points are “reserved” for more severe situations, and there is some truth to this pattern.

Stock markets were sliding as the tech bubble began to deflate with the Fed cut rates in January 2001 by 50 basis points. The bursting of a subprime mortgage-credit bubble in August 2007 preceded the Fed’s cut of the same magnitude in September 2007.

At the same time, Fed officials at both of those meetings still thought their more aggressive action might preempt a downturn, according to the transcripts of those meetings. In other words, just because 50-basis-point cuts look, in retrospect, like actions reserved for the start of a recession, officials didn’t think that way in real time.

I’m long PACS. 

What is it? Senior Care Living Facilities.

Why am I long? 

Industry trends:
The senior care Industry is growing at a compound anual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6%. The industry size is currently $958B but projected to be $1.22T by 2030. 
PACS is aggressively growing
Adding 32 new facilities and 12 real estate acquisitions, bringing the total operating facilities to 248 in only 13 states. They’re opening up to high demand regions like the south east and south west US. Focusing on quality. 165 of its facilities have 4-5 star ratings. 
Diversifying revenue streams:
Health and wellness programs going beyond basic healthcare. Focusing on lifestyle improvements and preventative care, catering to the demand for holistic wellness among seniors. Specialized services such as memory care. (YoY growth rate of Alzheimer’s is 2.47%)
Real Estate:
PACS owns its facilities and is ever expanding. They’re capturing operational income and property value appreciation. Their facilities have a 91% occupancy rate which is considered high for this industry. 
Value Based Care Models:
This focus’ on achieving better health outcomes while managing costs. They benefit from performance-based incentives, allowing the company to generate revenue based on the quality and efficiency of care provided rather than the volume of services.

Some numbers:
In Q2 they reported $0.54 EPS, beating the analyst predictions of $0.35. Reported revenue of $982.85 million, beating the predictions by 7.13% ($916.50 million)
Currently trading at 16.5x ebitda. High! But not unheard of, especially for a high growth company like PACS.

THE SINGULARITY HAS BEGUN

  


  
I'm not sure if you're paying any fucking attention to what nerds are building these days. Let's look at a few examples: 

- To start, Waymo has solved self-driving. Tesla is on the cusp of doing the same

- Tesla and like 5 other companies are about to come out with actual fucking cyborgs. Robot slaves are almost here. Be sure to treat yours nicely. 

- People are already falling in love with chatbots (imagine cyborgs v2?)

- TSMC and Nvidia turn literal sand into rocks that can teach themselves anything 

- People want these magic rocks so bad that nuclear power has been resurrected from the dead so we can use the hot rocks to power the smart rocks

- Oh and OpenAI just dropped their new model o1, creating yet another way to turn more GPU cycles into more intelligence. Except this time, the algorithm is less efficient. A \*linear\* improvement with \*exponential\* increase in GPU/energy. Meaning demand for GPUs just ...shot up... again (sounds crazy, but I see at least a doubling here). Nvidia isn't the only beneficiary here, but I expect that capture 90% of this newly discovered demand (more on this in another post)

POWELL IS A GENIUS

  


On to the main story of the day - what is Mr Pow-Pow gonna do? 

He's smart enough to understand that the stickiest part about inflation is housing. And no amount of low rates will ever solve housing. We can't choose to spend less on housing. Millenials and zoomers are fucking crammed in together. Housing has a supply issue. Not enough of it. And how is that solved? Build more. What does that cost? Money.

  
As paradoxical as it sounds, the solution to inflation has now become more money. We need construction to boom. Luckily, it is starting to. 

Powell also knows how to get a good price. How to ""stretch"" out his bps for the biggest societal changes.. Remember how skillfully he used the mere suggestion of rates drops to heat the economy up earlier this year. He got all that for 0 bps. 

So how can he get the most bang for his buck here? Start out with a bang. All else equal, a 50 bps now will create a bigger ""push"" of excitement through society than would two 25 bps back to back. He knows this. He'd rather give you 50 pbs now than 75 bps over 3. That's strategy - focussing on the war not the battle. So he creates a giant sigh of relief. He'll give us more up front. A nice little surprise from Santa Clause

Then the tapering will be slower than expected. That will get dialed back as the initial push shows to be effective. It'll be a classic Powell Tease.

We are entering an Age of Great Monopolies. Yes, the S&P500 is concentrated. But look around - globalization and rapidly changing high-tech have made economies of scale that are completely unbeatable. The richest people in the world have hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the new normal. 

  
Are you really gonna drop Amazon...or Nvidia...just to scoop up companies that have higher debt, because now that debt is worth slightly less? You want banks ridden with corporate property debt and underwater T-bills? Amazon will have next hour delivery. Tesla is going to have i Robots. People are already falling in love with sex robots. 

  
The singularity is here. This is what it looks like. You may not like it but this is what peak acceleration looks like. That means you should be expecting exponential growth, and looking for companies going through it. Buy and hold or calls if you have too much money.

The Pager Incident Is Bearish For US Tech Exports,"**This is not a political post. I just wanted to hear your thoughts about this issue.**

Given that China is already suspicious about western tech (as are we of China's) and basically after the 7th of October other big arab countries (UAE) have been very critical of Israel I think that these countries are gonna be very skeptical about buying more US products made in places like Taiwan. 

Even though Taiwan [denied that the pagers were made there](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/18/taiwan-dragged-into-middle-east-politics-after-deadly-pager-blasts) I'd be scarred if I was in a country that opposes Israel since they just proved that our own electronic devices can be made into lethal weapons. Basically they opened the door for many possible nightmarish scenarios. Imagine if your iPhone or NVIDIA GPU just explodes.

Anyway this might be a regarded thought but I'm interested in your responses.

No positions as of right now cuz I plan on losing money on rate cuts tonight.

**TLDR: Eastern countries may be too scarred to buy much more tech made in Taiwan/countries with US-Israel interest, now that Israel proved that they can use eevryday products as weapons.**

Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio Sees 0.25 Fed Cut as ‘Right Thing’ but ‘Size Won’t Matter in Long Run’,"> Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said the overall picture of the US economy probably warrants a smaller interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this week.

 > Whether it’s 25 or 50 basis points, 25 basis points would be the right thing to do if you look at the whole picture” —  ‘Right Thing’ for creditors.

> “If you look at the mortgage situation, which is worse and that affects more people, then it’s probably 50 basis points” — would help mortgage borrowers.

> But Dalio said that what the Fed does this week “doesn’t make a difference” over the longer term. 

> “I think it’s such a silly bet — 25 or 50,” he said. Policymakers will ultimately need to keep real interest rates low to enable the servicing of mounting debts, he added.

> Dalio isn’t the only financial luminary to express ambivalence about Fed policy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said whether the central bank cuts rates by 25 or 50 basis points, the move is “not going to be earth-shattering.” “They need to do it,” Dimon said at a conference on Tuesday.

'Twas the Night Before Rate Cuts,"'Twas the night before rate cuts, and all through the street,  
The regards all restless, in anticipation of heat.  

The bulls were all hopeful, their calls stacked with care,  
In hopes that ol' JPow would soon ease the scare.  

The bears held their breath, not trusting the game,  
They’d seen it before and knew who to blame.  

And I in my hoodie, the wife’s boyfriend on Zoom,  
Were glued to the charts as we sat in one room.  

When out on the web there arose such a flash,  
I closed my meme stocks, fearing a crash.  

I glanced at my screen, feeling jittery and raw,  
And there on the timeline—what I feared—I saw.  

It was Powell and gang, in a frenzy no less,  
Discussing rate cuts, the markets a mess.  

“Cut by 25? Or maybe by 50?”  
Whispered the bulls, feeling quite nifty.  

But JPow just smirked as he held up hand,  
“You think you’re in charge? You misunderstand.”  

“The cuts are coming, sure as you bet,  
But inflation’s a beast we haven’t tamed yet.”  

And I groaned as I watched, knowing what he would say,  
“You’ll buy the dip, but your gains fade away.”  

I stood by my screen, my face filled with doubt,  
""How can I win if he bails markets out?”  

He laughed as he left, and I knew in that flash,  
That even with rate cuts, I'd still lose my cash.  

So I sat down again, hand on my head,  
I’m just a regard, and Powell’s in our bed. ",4043,1726616864.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fjet46/twas_the_night_before_rate_cuts/

"J pow will talk to us nice tomorrow (AMAT, SPY, HOOD, SNAP)","The stock heat-map will look like a freshly mown lawn by the end of the day tomorrow.

It is undeniable that the thought of ruining this election for the Democratic Party with a hawkish speech tomorrow has crossed J POW’s mind and is slim to none. If the economy crashes, there is no chance Kamala gets elected. The public will shift their gaze to a more authoritative business person, Donald Trump. 

It is my humble belief that J pow will bless us with a calm, confident, and data-focused .25 base point rate cut. 

Last week, when they cut rates in Europe, we saw a massive uptick during the latter part of week. 

These are my positions - mainly stocks that I like, but also some lottery tickets in there in case they takeoff huge.

Instead of being long TSLL (gain of 8.9%) it makes sense to short the inverse (gain of 10.9%) to capitalize on both the direction and the volatility decay. Am I missing something here?

$EXAS - Exact Sciences,"**Exact Sciences (EXAS)** is a molecular diagnostics company primarily known for developing and manufacturing screening tests for cancer. Their most well-known product is Cologuard, a non-invasive, stool-based DNA test that screens for colon cancer and precancerous polyps. It’s widely used as an alternative to traditional colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening.

In addition to Cologuard, Exact Sciences also focuses on developing other diagnostic tests for early cancer detection, particularly in areas like breast, liver, and lung cancer. They emphasize molecular and genomic technologies to advance precision medicine in oncology.

Recently, Exact Sciences has been making headlines due to its advancements in cancer diagnostics, particularly with its efforts to develop a blood-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test. In mid-September 2024, the company presented promising data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, showing that their new blood test has a sensitivity of 88.3% for colorectal cancer and 31.2% for advanced precancerous lesions. This innovation could potentially serve as a non-invasive alternative to current tests, expanding CRC screening to millions of unscreened individuals.

Additionally, Exact Sciences is working on a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, which showed an overall sensitivity of 54.8% for cancers without standard screening options and 63.7% for the most aggressive cancers. The company aims to submit its blood-based CRC test to the FDA by 2025, marking a significant step forward in non-invasive cancer screening options.

These innovations are positioning Exact Sciences as a leader in the diagnostic field, with broad implications for cancer detection and prevention.

Several large pharmaceutical and biotech companies could be potential acquirers of Exact Sciences due to its leadership in the cancer diagnostics space, particularly with its successful Cologuard test and promising pipeline in blood-based cancer screenings. Some of the potential acquirers could include:

**Pfizer:** Pfizer has been looking to diversify its portfolio and expand its oncology pipeline, making it a strong candidate. It already has a collaboration history with Exact Sciences, as Pfizer once had a marketing partnership for Cologuard.

**Roche:** Roche, a global leader in diagnostics, might be interested in Exact Sciences due to its complementary diagnostic technologies, particularly in early cancer detection and precision medicine.

**Abbott Laboratories:** Abbott, a giant in the medical devices and diagnostics field, could see strategic value in acquiring Exact Sciences to strengthen its position in cancer diagnostics and leverage synergies with its own diagnostic platforms.

**Thermo Fisher Scientific:** Thermo Fisher, which has a strong focus on genomics and molecular diagnostics, could be interested in acquiring Exact Sciences to further its expansion into cancer diagnostics and early detection.

**Illumina:** As a leader in sequencing technologies, Illumina could consider buying Exact Sciences to expand its footprint in early cancer detection, particularly as both companies have overlapping interests in genomic diagnostics and precision medicine.

The all-time high for Exact Sciences (EXAS) stock occurred on January 18, 2021, when it reached a peak price of $159.54 per share.

This surge came amid strong growth in its cancer screening business, particularly with the success of its Cologuard test and expectations surrounding its pipeline of new diagnostic products.

The pipeline hungry giants could easily justify a 10x current sales ratio. At $2.5 billion in current revenue that would place a buyout at $25 billion.  Less $2.4 billion in debt that is 22.5 billion for equity. At 184.77 million shares outstanding that is approximately $121.77 per share. Or 77% upside.

**Position of interest:** Long November $90 calls and 500 shares. Plan to roll calls in November.",20,1726583050.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fj0l4q/exas_exact_sciences/

• ""Since peaking at $1.5 trillion in 2021, tech transaction volume has plummeted, dropping to $544 billion last year, according to Dealogic. So far in 2024, that number sits at $465 billion.""

___

"at FED MEETING Keep an eye on the Balance sheet news, not the rate cut.","The world of investing regards keep talking about what the FED will do with rates and how much they are going to cut but that's not nearly as important as what the balance sheet news could be. 

Right now, they are still tapering. They cut tapering drastically in May (and surprise surprise noone in the media noticed) and back then Powell said (not a quote, just what i remember): 

""we slowed the pace of tapering SO THAT we don't scare the fin markets and we could run the tapering for much much longer"".

My bet is that they won't cut tapering or Powell is a mad ass liar in the first place.

Now, should they keep the pace of tapering as it is, then i'm anticipating a decline in SP500 in the second half of this month (which is already here). 

TL;DR: REGARDLESS of how much they're going to cut, if tapering is untouched, the markets will fall.

"Small bet in $ONON, expecting awesome quarter result with Olympic fever","I recently bought ON Holding call options after doing some research, and I was surprised to see how popular the brand is with younger people and the middle class. I tried their shoes in-store, and they were super comfortable—both my wife and nephew are fans too. I’ve even noticed athletes at the Olympics and Google’s Sergey Brin rocking the brand.

Here’s my take:

* I think ON Holding could become the next Nike, but it needs more time to grow.
* Their next financial results should be strong, especially with all the Olympic hype.
* The price chart looks really bullish, breaking through resistance levels and heading toward an all-time high.

That said, there’s one downside: their valuation is way higher than their competitors. If earnings don’t catch up, this stock could end up being seriously overvalued.

NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Points to $1 Trillion Opportunity for the Company,"Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.

Lee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:

However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.

For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points **(**[**see more details here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)**).**

***Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179***

Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing.

“We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill.

Huang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.

Nvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.

Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.

At Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.

Of course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.

Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its [**Q2 2024 investor letter**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/heres-why-nvidia-corporation-nvda-appreciated-in-q2-1346747/):

A costly experiment in playing weeklies,"The journey this year: 

First half of this year, I was skeptical of the market and had quit my job, so I didn't touch my accounts. 

Then, I decided to experiment with options. I started small, trying to apply my investment lessons to longer-term monthlies (4-6 mo expiry). It went pretty well, for a while, made a bunch off the rotation trade into small-caps and consumer discretionary. Got caught a little by wide bid/ask spreads, and a bad entry on the NVDA rebound, but nothing too bad. 

Then I had the brilliant idea to try intraday trading weeklies. No 0 DTE, because Fidelity (thank you broker). Tried trading MA crossovers like a regard, then tried some trend-following using VWAP. Got eaten alive by 🦀 movement. Was up 60% three days ago, now I'm down 25% on the year. Gonna take a while to get it back now, and really.kickling myself hard for being an impulsive regard.

TL;DR: I made a bunch rotation trading longer-term monthlies. Then I tried weeklies like a regard. RIP my ROTH. ",75,1726525743.0,https://i.redd.it/lg68ffngz8pd1.jpeg

CME FedWatch Tool Methodology is Flawed. 0.50% rate cut is not going to happen.,"TL;DR: CME tool says 67% chance of 50bps rate reduction, I believe this number is closer to 50%. CME tool says 0% chance of rates staying the same, I believe this number is closer to 20%. 

At the moment, this is what you see when you go to the fedwatch [website](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html):

[100% chance of rate reduction!](https://i.imgur.com/J53yE08.png)

They sure do seem very confident don't they? With a 67% chance of a 0.50% rate reduction, seems excessive?

If you read into the methodology, you'll see that it's by design that there are only two options. The FedWatch calculation looks at what futures are trading at, and simplistically allocates a probability to the two closest 25bps. This is at best, an oversimplification, and at worst, misleading and wrong data. It's no surprise that these predictions have been so consistently wrong in the past few years.

Not to bore you all with the large details, but in short using a bit of high school stats you can come up with some more sensible figures:
[See here](https://i.imgur.com/QvA1AJ1.png)

As you can see, I believe there's roughly a 20% chance of no rate reduction, which makes sense. It's unlikely rates will stay flat, but to say there's 0% chance is misleading. A miss in inflation, unemployment, or other data could lead the FOMC to not reduce monetary policy.

The graph is slightly out of date (bond and futures market move quick!) but you can see that a 50bps reduction is closer to 50% (i.e. a coinflip) rather than the 67% being quoted by CME (2/3 chance).

Some more info on my methodology for anyone interested:

The current methodology of calculating the probability of changes to the Fed's fund target rate only allows for two options

This is evident ahead of the FOMC meeting on the 18th of September, where there is likely to be 1 to 2 rate reductions (graph on left)

However, my main concern is the fact that the calculation and therefore the tables indicate that there is a 0% chance rates staying (or even being hiked)

Whilst this is unlikely, the probability is not 0%. Therefore, showing such simplistic probabilities is misleading, and investors/traders may not be fully informed.

I've suggested a method which doesn't rely on any additional assumptions, using the Poisson Distribution, where the average number of rate cuts is calculated in the same manner.

TL;DR: CME tool says 67% chance of 50bps rate reduction, I believe this number is closer to 50%. CME tool says 0% chance of rates staying the same, I believe this number is closer to 20%

$ARKG The Ultimate Rate Cut Play,"Following on from my [$BNTX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cy0tfp/bntx_17b_cash_with_no_debt_huge_pipeline_news/) idea posted earlier in the year, which whilst being early played out beautifully and the mis pricing of [$RKLB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cwku7q/rklb_everybody_left_as_the_party_gets_started/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) options which also played out beautifully, I feel the rates cuts, pending catalysts and extreme hate towards cathie woods could fuel a Genomic rally.

[Weekly chart of ARKG, Via TC200](https://preview.redd.it/3drgn26sy4pd1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbc4b60c50d22b405efe9b63f0afca0e5b78b06)

It’s no secret that the market has been pricing in the potential September rate cut in many sectors, considering it will be the first in 4 years. The thesis is, this will inevitably lead investors into taking on more risk in speculative names in search of higher yields. It also lowers the payments for companies/sectors that rely heavily on debt to fuel growth. It plays a big role in the IWM thesis and it’s potential to finally begin a bull run. Whilst IWM and other sectors are already pricing in this potential move and their respective option chains getting juiced, there are many still that have been forgotten.

As of late we’ve seen names like $BNTX $SMMT and many more start to break out in an aggressive manner. With XBI heading back towards 52 week highs and individual names such as $BEAM $CRSP $RXRX all pivoting on Friday with BEAM + 7.75%, $NTLA + 6.24% and CRSP 6.41%; many of their options chains are getting juiced/expensive. Which is hardly surprising, as a lot of the genomic names post huge updates in the coming weeks and rate cuts are incredibly bullish for the sector.

[XBI \(Biotech\) Preparing for a monthly bull flag breakout.](https://preview.redd.it/e8o1sby8f5pd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=473f54ac08af471c8b4a137de91f20d9aa638048)

However, thanks to the hate towards cathie woods right now and her entire list of funds, $ARKG, which contains all of the names above and more has been left behind. In fact, the fund has a 30% sI against it which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make. This is the exact same thing I noticed with $BNTX, it had been totally forgotten, leaving the options to become extremely cheap, until everybody wanted in of course.

I have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have, their short floats, fund positioning and when data is likely to be released. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts on Wednesday, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.

Biotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even as AI continues to show signs of massively helping the industry. Cathie wood has become one of the most hated and laughed at fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn’t being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.

In the last couple of weeks we’re actually seeing institutional inflow into ARKG and many of the individual holdings themselves, which suggests a potential turning point is on the horizon.

The genomic sector is complex and very few understand the intricate details of each company. $ARKG is therefore the easiest way for many to get exposure, as money piles in it pushes the individual holdings higher causing a covering in individual holdings and the underlying securities, creating a snowball effect.

Once this even begins to take place I’m expecting to see a surge in IV and essentially ARKG options priced much more aggressively. Biotech is known for huge and oversized moves thanks to the very difficult nature of pricing the underlying security. I’m expecting this to happen in the next couple of days.

Last Call on Applovin,"A “distribution” onto retail has been prepped for quite some time. If there was a time to tighten the grip on long positions, I believe that now would be the time.

Things the politically correct  way of putting things:

Investor Concerns Mount Over Applovin (APP) Amid Lawsuits, Insider Sell-offs, and Questionable Fundamentals

[Palo Alto, Ca] – Applovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) is facing heightened scrutiny from investors, particularly retail traders, due to ongoing legal battles, insider selling activity, and questions surrounding the company’s long-term growth strategy. These concerns come at a time when Applovin is promoting its business aggressively through public relations campaigns, while several shareholder lawsuits and investigations raise critical red flags.

Growth in Revenue Overshadowed by Structural Weaknesses

In its Q2 2024 earnings report, Applovin announced revenue growth of $1.08 billion and generated $446 million in free cash flow, signaling strong operational performance. However, the mobile gaming market, which forms the backbone of Applovin’s revenue, is experiencing slower growth. The company’s expansion into e-commerce advertising—a promising vertical—is still in its pilot phase, with meaningful contributions not expected until 2025  .

Insider Activity Raises Investor Alarms

In recent months, insiders have sold significant portions of their Applovin shares, raising concerns about the company’s long-term outlook. SEC filings reveal that insiders have sold shares worth millions, with major sell-offs occurring around key price milestones and vesting periods . With a substantial portion of the company’s stock controlled by hedge funds, index funds, and insiders, retail investors are questioning whether these large shareholders are aligned with their interests.

Lawsuits Amplify Investor Skepticism

Applovin is also embroiled in a series of legal challenges, including the Mitchell vs. Applovin case, which alleges breaches of fiduciary duty and misleading statements by the company. Shareholder lawsuits like this are focused on whether Applovin’s leadership failed to disclose critical risks, further undermining investor confidence  . Additionally, investigations by firms such as Schall Law and Purcell & Lefkowitz LLP are examining whether Applovin issued false or misleading statements that could have contributed to investor losses .

Profitability in Question Amid Legal and Business Challenges

While Applovin boasts impressive EBITDA margins of 81%, the company’s future profitability is under pressure. Expected margin compression in the core app segment and slower user acquisition growth signal potential headwinds. Combined with the looming legal risks and insider selling, these factors raise doubts about the company’s ability to sustain its current financial performance .

Conclusion: Caution Urged for Investors

With the convergence of legal risks, insider profit-taking, and potential structural weaknesses, investors are encouraged to proceed with caution. The aggressive PR push promoting Applovin’s business may not reflect the full picture, as lawsuits and shareholder concerns grow louder. Retail investors, in particular, should consider these factors when evaluating Applovin’s long-term investment prospects.

[WSB DD PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ey7d8i/gold_sector_internals_update_for_wednesday_august/)

I'll (try to) keep this concise.  First of all Gold is in a full blown bull market and headed much higher in the coming years.  I laid out the fundamentals in the links above.  If that is true (that gold is in a full fledged bull market) it normally holds true that Silver starts to out perform at some point and that process may have already started.  The drivers for the precious metals are straight forward 

* 35T of debt in the present
* 200T of debt in the future
* 200T of derivatives in the US banking system
* Asset rotation from growth/tech to value/commodities
* Yield curve steepening (after longest inversion in history), unemployment rising
* London (LBMA) and COMEX under pressure
* Geopolitical risks, war cycle, BRICS meeting this October regarding gold backing
* Basal III allows central banks to hold tier-1 asset gold at full value 
* India and China buying up physical silver, no one in the west owns any yet, solar sector and solar technology developments bullish to compete for annual silver supply against investment demand

I should stop there.  

First I want to take a look at the Silver to Gold ratio.  It's been out of whack for a while and I think I know why.  I'll put that in part 2.

Betting against JP Morgan and also buying calls on Victoria secret ,"Firstly, about JP Morgan.

This is a bank we all know, some hate them some love them. However, I am just here for the money.

From the 2008 crisis to the effect of COVID and the current bearish thesis of Jamie Dimon. I believe he knows something. 

But in that case why did he not shorten JP Morgan investment strategy? Jp Morgan bank has high leverage, long term investments, and with the capital requirement from the government it is logical to see the price fall.

Rate cut is generally not beneficial for banks. Banks make money from the difference of cost and profit trading from its users and lower rate means lower fee.

My idea is Jamie believes the market is going down either way and all he can do is diversified investments, lay off but the decline in the short-term is inevitable.

Part 2 about Victoria Secret

This one is easier to understand.

1/ change in management bullish
2/ rate cut bullish 
3/ CPI stable bullish
4/ Partnership with other brands bullish
5/ restructuring business equal bullish.

Forget the Kelly Criterion: YOLO Everything,"Who has time for caution? Why waste precious moonshot opportunities by only betting 10% of your portfolio when you can go all in and ride the rocket? Sure, the Kelly Criterion might give you some mathematical comfort, but let’s be real, this isn’t a spreadsheet simulation. This is the wild west of Wall Street, and you don’t get ahead by hedging bets and taking “sensible” risks.



Honestly, if you’re only betting 10% on that once-in-a-lifetime trade, you might as well not even bother. The whole point is to make generational wealth, not crawl your way to modest gains. 10% gains? Enviable gains? Nah, we're talking about flipping entire portfolios here. You’re not in this for a “sensible capital allocation” you’re in this to YOLO it all and come out on top.

And yeah, I hear the caution about that 1% scenario where you lose everything. Guess what? That’s the game. This isn’t some safety net strategy for the faint-hearted. Go big, or go home. If you’re gonna play Russian Roulette, don’t worry about how many barrels are in the revolver just pull the damn trigger. If you're worried about a ""pending recession,"" then you’re already losing.



You know what’s even worse than losing? Watching something moon while you sit on the sidelines clutching your Kelly Criterion spreadsheet, kicking yourself for not going all in. Because when your bets don’t land, you’ll be just as broke whether you risked 10% or 100%, so might as well swing for the fences.

If you’re really that scared of losing, you’re not built for this game. But if you’re here to make the history books, it’s time to put it all on the line. Don’t Google “Kelly Criterion.” Google “how to live like a legend.”

"Balance before the storm, the week ahead.","MANY DOUBTED MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE BUT MOST OF MY CALLS WERE PERFECT: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fbgpyh/why_the_market_bottomed_on_friday_a_technical/

# What's next?

## Balance before the storm

Yes, I know there are always a few out there who scoffed at my bullish calls last week. I get it—you’ve been conditioned by fear, anxiety, and headlines screaming about recessions and doom. But while you’ve been stuck in your perpetual state of “this can’t last,” the market has entered a phase of equilibrium. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are losing steam, and we’re sitting at the tipping point.

This week, the S&P 500 (SPX) will likely go nowhere—give or take a measly 0.5%. But within that broad stillness, there are opportunities. As I said before, I'm still holding onto my $600 call for Meta by 11/11, and now, I’ve added a $250 call for Tesla as well. Why? Because the setups for these two stocks are that compelling, and anyone betting against them is simply ignoring the writing on the wall. But there's more brewing this week, including an under-the-radar SMCI catalyst and the geopolitical noise that never seems to let up. Let’s dig in.

### The Bulls Are Ready, The Bears Are Tired
We’re entering a rare moment of balance this week. The bears, after months of trying to claw the market down, are losing momentum. It’s no surprise—their thesis was built on inflation fears, rate hikes, and market collapses that have yet to materialize in any significant way. Sure, the economic data is mixed, and yes, the Federal Reserve’s game of chicken with the economy continues. But in reality, the worst-case scenarios haven’t played out. And the bulls? They’re rested, ready, and growing stronger by the day.

This week, expect the SPX to consolidate. +/- 0.5%, at most, as the market digests the ongoing news flow. It’s a classic tug-of-war situation, where the opposing sides are evenly matched. Bulls have been fortified by recent strength in big tech (Meta, Tesla), while bears are nursing wounds from failed short positions. It’s a delicate balance—but don’t be surprised if the scale tips toward a breakout soon. My bets are positioned accordingly.

### Meta: The $600 Target Is Alive
First up, Meta. Let’s be real, if you didn’t already jump on this train when I first mentioned it, you’re already behind. Last week, Meta continued to show relative strength, outperforming even in a market that’s trying to catch its breath. And the setup only looks better going forward. The metaverse, digital advertising recovery, and AI momentum—Meta has all the catalysts to reach $600 by 11/11. If you're still doubting this, you clearly haven't been watching the technicals. Momentum is on our side.

I’m still holding onto my $600C, and if the market gives us any pullback this week, I’ll probably add more. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

### Tesla: Charging Towards $250
As for Tesla, my new $250 call is straightforward. Tesla has been trading in a tight range, coiling like a spring. When Tesla consolidates like this, it’s only a matter of time before the breakout happens, and I’m betting that it’s going to be upward. Between the continued push into EV dominance, Elon’s ongoing antics that somehow keep Tesla in the headlines, and institutional money that loves to chase momentum, Tesla is primed.

Look, Tesla has defied gravity for years, and its ability to move with news-driven momentum is second to none. With nothing but green skies ahead, $250 feels conservative. I’ll happily ride the wave higher.

### SMCI: The Under-the-Radar Winner
Now, let’s talk about SMCI. I’ve been keeping an eye on this one for a while, and with their 10K expected this week, I’m looking to load up on some calls before the release. This is one of those quiet setups where the risk/reward ratio is too good to pass up. SMCI has been steadily gaining traction, and while it’s not plastered across every financial news headline, the fundamentals speak for themselves.

Once that 10K drops, I expect the stock to move, and those of us who were paying attention beforehand are going to profit. Watch closely here—don’t sleep on it.

### The Noise: Futures Rollovers, FOMC, and Geopolitical Drama
Of course, no week is complete without some good old-fashioned chaos. Futures are rolling over this week, which means we could see some positioning shifts from the big players. This always adds an extra layer of volatility, especially when you combine it with the Fed’s looming FOMC meeting. Everyone will be dissecting Jerome Powell’s every word, as always, but if you’ve been watching carefully, you’ll notice a softer tone from the Fed. They’re trying to engineer a soft landing, and while I have my doubts about their precision, the market is liking what it hears.

Then there’s the elephant in the room: Mango. There are ripple effects from the latest developments in his ongoing legal saga, with new speculation swirling about potential international involvement. Ukraine? Russia? Who knows at this point, but geopolitical uncertainty always adds a little spice to the market’s reaction. Throw in the fact that no one can seem to locate Ms.Plan —where is it?

### Final Thoughts: Keep Betting on Winners
In summary, this week might be flat for the broader market, but there are pockets of opportunity for those who know where to look. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are weakening, and we’re at a moment of equilibrium. But don’t get lulled into complacency. Meta and Tesla are leading the charge, and SMCI is gearing up to surprise everyone. Meanwhile, the political and economic noise will continue to distract the masses. Stay focused on the winners, and you’ll be the one laughing at the doubters in the end.

Case for positive SP500 following rate cuts,"The short answer to “What will happen when the Fed Cuts rates?” is that it depends, however in the below article from Fidelity, they make a pretty strong case for a strong next 12 months following the upcoming rate cuts.

While the short term can still be volatile and could see a decline, they point out the following 3 things that bode well for equities:

1. Earnings growth continues to remain strong and as the cost to borrow $ goes down, that should help companies boost growth even more

2. Historically, the gap we currently have between where the Fed rate is at vs current inflation levels has correlated with an average of 14% returns— this is based on data starting in 1962.

3. The combination of rates falling with an acceleration of Leading Economic indicators and an increase is Bank’s willingness to lend (which are all occurring) has also lead to an average of +17% and +15% returns, respectively 

This isn’t investment advice and there is always the chance of a black swan event or major changes to current data, but at least something to consider as you plan your moves.

"For the love of god, google ""Kelly Criterion""","It doesn't matter if you are 99% sure that your YOLO will moon because of the transit of Uranus or something. It's heartbreaking to see people posting losses amounting to years of savings, I was also seriously considering a YOLO on long SPY puts until I came across this concept because I'm feeling super sure about a pending recession. Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).

The gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.

If you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.

Microsoft Bubble?,"So, I’ve been kicking this around, and I figured you guys would be the best judge of it.

Is there a Microsoft ‘Bubble’ (I dunno if I’m using that right, it feels weird). Anyway, here’s my thinking?

At what point do AAA games start marketing you microtransactions? From the very start, they’re that valuable. So, what does that mean for the RRP? It has lesser value than microtransactions. Played out, there’s a break-even point where forgoing the RRP altogether will still be worth it. Are we seeing that already, faithful reader?

The cutthroat efficiency of capitalism will mean that the endgame will be all games. Free. Forever.

So where does that leave Xbox and game pass? I’ll ask you a better question. What does that mean for the ‘x as a service’ model?

You buy Disney+, do you pay 5 on top for the Mandalorian?

This is the endgame of capitalism. It’s efficiency is too ruthless. It is cannibalising its customers. Everything in the software service will cede to microtransactions. Service models will become redundant.

So, yeah, short Microsoft. Tips welcome.

Why November fed rate decision is more important than Sept,"Since Sept federal rate decision is already priced into the market and the 0.5% rate cut seems improbable, the major kicker will be the November rate decision. If Fed decides to hold it depending on election results (though Powell keeps saying he is an apolitical decision maker and he pretty much lying there) and the rate are held steady instead of a cut, I expect a deep dip in the market. Hence I have short term calls on SPY that expire September and ling term puts that expire December. 

Now you might ask why would fed hold it steady in November - my calc says we have not stabilized inflation and job market will remain strong due to holiday season with seasonal labor increase and extensive spending during the holiday season. There will be no metric that will help Fed lean towards the 0.75% to 1.25% rate cut expected for all of 2024. It will be a debacle. The next rate cut is in 2025 folks. 

I would really like to be told why I am wrong. ",163,1726425072.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fhjj4q/why_november_fed_rate_decision_is_more_important/
Intel is a good buy,"We are all well aware Intel is having it's own Boeing moment right now with design flaws in their CPUs and horrible customer service. They deserve the steaming pile dooky that is currently sitting atop their share value. That being said, they have an ace that may flip the entire market on it's head: They own their fabs.

That's right: all the other big boys in town design and give their blueprints for TSMC to manufacture. That's true of AMD, Nvidia, and other ARM and mobile chip designers. Intel is the only large scale chip designers that is more or less vertically integrated. As you may know, they just got $8.8B from papa Biden to build more foundries in Ohio and Arizona, in addition to their other sites across the world. 

None of this is particularly noteworthy until you consider that China has always been very interested in Chinesing Taiwan, and are even more so now that they have been embargoed from Nvidia chips by the US. The Chinese military build-up over the past decade has focused heavily on amphibious warfare, and long range anti-naval weapons (think carrier buster ballistic/boost-glide stand off weapons.) It doesn't take a Ph.D in geopolitics to understand what the move is here. 

On the US/allied side, the discourse around Taiwan has slowly shifted: what started out as ""we have overwhelming force and we will stop any attempt at an invasion of Taiwan"" has become something like ""Maybe we can't stop them from invading, but we can make it a Pyrrhic victory"". This may actually be the case, but the trend is not great. You will have noticed Taiwan has been increasingly politically isolated, mirroring the growing Chinese military power in the region. So what happens to TSMC if Taiwan gets Chinesed?

As you can imagine, China is interested in acquiring as many TSMC assets and personnel intact as possible. This means you can bet your degenerate bacon that US intelligence services have contingencies to extradite key scientists and engineers, and scuttle the production plants and machines before the Chinese can take control of them. But the result is easy to predict: no more TSMC. This means the personnel extradited will be used to advise and run US production plants owned by, you guessed it: Intel.

Intel will have a quasi monopoly on chip manufacturing. The US government see this of course, that's why they are strongly nudging Nvidia to play nice with Intel, because they see a potential future where Intel is the only player in town capable of making Nvidia chips, or any consumer chips at all for that matter, in the West. Also, Intel shares are below $20 a pop right now. Do what you will with this info. ",0,1726421553.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fhi4n9/intel_is_a_good_buy/

SeptemBEAR 🐻‍❄️🤷🏼‍♂️,"We are officially halfway through the month of September, which has historically been a bearish month.

And such was the case for the first week, until the market decided to recover almost to the exact same point it was when it left August.

I missed out on an extremely valuable post showing market performance on 9/11 and even though I went with calls that morning they were decimated before the market did a big JUST KIDDING WATCH ME MOVE to reverse everything and go on a solid run to close the week.

I will be buying puts from here until the end of the month, in smaller batches and DCAing when needed. Praying for some volatility and another reversal of the reversal of the reversal. First week was red, 2nd week green, major indices are showing a 4-6 day green run and I believe it will relinquish it back. RSI is picking up not into super overbought territory but we all know the market is not really showing how frail the economy is with regards to consumer spend/debt and stability.

Current position 15x 9/20 exp $476p QQQ cb $2.92. QQQ closed August around this amount and is basically back to that level. 

Eyeing things a little further out end of month QQQ $460p for under $3 feels pretty good or even $470p for around $5 for less risk.

"Listen regards, my next speculation is $COST will split and rip.","I'm the degenerate that bought way OTM calls on $DG and $DLTR because $1 stores are trash and the options were cheap lotto tickets. How you find these plays; get a thesis going, then check for lottery tickets, then manage your risk. 

The play? The deepest OTM calls on $COST, at various strikes and dates as follows:  


10/4 1040c for $1.67/each  
10/18 1200c for $0.40/each  
12/20 1300c for $0.69/each.  
  
I started earlier this week with the 980 and 990 calls, but they were up 80% and 33% respectively, so I sold those and loaded up on the above. 

I know what you're thinking, ""Dude, you're fucking stupid"". A little, but besides the point. Here's the thesis. 

1) Its fucking Costco. Just look at that chart. Speaking of chart?  
2) $COST is the $NVDA of grocery stores, essentially. Better and better every year, since they both opened. Well run companies, good products and financials, blah blah blah. Why compare to NVDA? The split.   
3) The strikes on the options chains. DG was a play because the 100p were cheap and was a critical level on the chart. DLTR on the other hand? **Yes, the 65p was also at a key level on the chart. But 65 was the lowest strike on the chain.** 

Think about it. If the stock prices goes higher (or lower) than the highest (or lowest) strike on the chain, the people writing those options have **NO** hedge. 

How? Well, not everyone is a degenerate monkey like we all are. They hedge, instead of zero to hero shit. 

For those unfamiliar with options, here's the ELI5 of it. I write (sell to open) an option, I collect the premium (price paid per contract). I get the money; you get the contract. Contract expires, dope, I get 'free' money. Contract goes ITM, I'm boned, now I have to buy or sell 100 shares to fulfill the contract. At a loss. An example. 

Say I think WMT will go down by next Friday, to $75. WMT is now $80.60/share. 

So, I write a 75c for WMT (sell to open) that expires 9/20 and collect \~$6.10 in premium. 1 of 3 things will happen. 

1) WMT hits $75, or below by 9/20. Instead of $5 ITM, it is barely ITM and only worth $1.06/contract. So, I buy one of the contracts for $1.06 to ""buy to close"". Sold it for $6.10, bought it back for $1.06, I keep the $5.04 in extra premium in my pocket.

2) Stock price does nothing, pretty much all week. The option is still $5 ITM by Friday, but worth less than the $6.10 I wrote it for on Monday. Price is still the same, but now there is less than 24 hours to expiration instead of 5 days. You buy to close the same option back for $3-4, still collect $1-2 in premium. 

3) WMT rips to $85, now the option you wrote is $10 ITM and is worth $10. Either it gets exercised and you lose money, or you buy to open another contract for $10 and still lose money.  

So, how do you hedge for the possibility of scenario 3? You buy the 80c for $1.06 roughly. If WMT does rip to $85 that week, yes the 75c you wrote is worth $10 instead of $5. But the 80c you bought as a hedge for $1.06 is now $5 ITM and is worth the same $5 you lost on the contract you wrote. That is the hedge

  
Why bring all of this up like I have any idea of what I'm talking about? 

**Well, what happens when the $75 is the highest strike on the options chain? You can't buy the 80c for a hedge, because it does not exist.** 

That is where the play comes in. If COST posts good ER (usually do because they're COST, and increased membership so money money) **AND** they announce a split on their 9/26 ER? This thing absolutely rips. 

**IF** this happens, $1100 is my price target by 10/4. 

**This is a BIG IF so position yourself with money you are comfortable seeing go to ZERO.**

But if this does work? We can all buy our own Wendy's. 

Let us assume that this play works as I'm imagining it and COST hits $1050-$1100/share by 10/4.   
  
- The 10/4 1040c will be $10-60 ITM, \~$17.50-$52.50/each up from $1.67/each  
- The 10/18 1200c will be $100-150 OTM instead of $280 OTM. Hard to estimate from options chain, but definitely worth more than the 0.40/each we buy them for. And, by 10/18, those could possibly even be ITM also.   
- The 12/20 1300c will also be worth more than we paid for them. 

I'll post my positions below in a photo, with some charts. 

This is my next play, and I'm putting up 10% of my capital at risk on it. 

If you only want one option to keep track of, go with the 10/4 1040c for sure. 

Currently, they are $1.67/each. **START a position, don't fucking load up on them all at once! Risk only what you're willing to see go to ZERO.**

So, whatever 1% of your capital is. Risk that and start the position on Monday. Whether that is 1, 10, or 100 contracts. Fuck it. Only 1-2% of your capital. 

After that, watch and observe. Options go down and value and are less than $1.67/each? Then add more. This is what I will be doing, until the total of the bet accounts for 10% of my bankroll. 5% if you want to be conservative, but I'm risking 10% on this one. 

***tl;dr: I'm regarded and think COST will do a stock split, and will rip past 1060 (to put options writers in an awkward and unhedged position). $COST will rip to $1100 by 10/4, and the 1040c will be $1-$60 ITM. They're only $1.67/each right now, cheap lotto tickets with decent enough odds.***",631,1726367919.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fh2imi/listen_regards_my_next_speculation_is_cost_will/
"Prognosis ER , freight me FDX down below , see chart","FedEx is set to report its earnings for Q3 2024 on September 19th, following the market close. The current consensus for earnings per share (EPS) is projected at $4.87, with expected revenue reaching approximately $21.93 billion. As always, market participants will be closely watching the company's guidance to better gauge future performance, as clarity here will be essential for setting expectations moving forward.

While I don't possess the ability to predict outcomes with certainty, I can offer insights based on a technical analysis of the chart.

For instance, consider the price action on December 19, 2023, a Tuesday, when FedEx stock reached a high of $285. Despite the initial upward momentum, the market found no acceptance at that price level, leading to a breakdown following the earnings report. Similarly, on March 22, 2024 (Friday), the stock surged upward, once again testing the $285-$289 range. However, as the auction process failed to establish sustained acceptance at this level, the price declined shortly afterward.

Most notably, the earnings report on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, left a significant gap on the chart. According to technical principles such as gap theory, it’s likely that the price action in upcoming sessions will aim to retest the lower levels and potentially fill the gap that was created.",22,1726364048.0,https://i.redd.it/0d9dvrsnmvod1.png

Stonkz only go Uppies?,"Sup regards,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

VIX and FOMC DD,"Positions 127 UVIX 9/20 6c at $0.14 average. I plan to halve on the double and then assess an exit plan for the rest, or more likely, I’ll just mess it all up and lose money.

Update 2: I sold the last 20 for 18¢ and I’m fully out of the position. I plan to monitor and possibly re-enter the trade closer to 10¢ or at a lower strike.

PACS: Prestige acquisition finalized so earnings will soar,"PACS operates skilled nursing facilities in the western US.  The company had its IPO in April of this year and is up 77% since then.  But it’s still undervalued.

PACS generally leases facilities. They pay rent, taxes, maintenance and wages.  Revenue comes from insurance reimbursement based on number of residents and services provided to those residents.

The largest 9 skilled nursing facility (SNF) operators only manage 11% of total SNFs in the USA.  This means that the vast majority of SNFs are managed by small operators or are individually owned.  Some of these facilities are well run and efficient, but many of them aren’t.  So, there are incredible opportunities for large operators, like PACS, that can take over leases of poorly run facilities and greatly improve income.  These turnarounds generally take around 18 months.  

ENSG is another company in the same business as PACS.  ENSG is up around 1000% in 10 years.  This just shows that there’s a lot of potential in SNF consolidation.

PACS announced, just this week, that they finalized a huge acquisition.   [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910499494/en/PACS-Group-Extends-Footprint-Services-to-Pacific-Northwest-and-Other-States](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240910499494/en/PACS-Group-Extends-Footprint-Services-to-Pacific-Northwest-and-Other-States) They have now taken over operations of Prestige Care’s entire SNF portfolio: 53 facilities.  PACS operated 220 facilities before the acquisition, so this is a 24% increase in facility count.  

The 53 new facilities are mostly located in the Pacific Northwest: near Portland and in Washington state.  I was able to find occupancy data for most of the new facilities from CMS.  I calculated an average occupancy rate of only 69%.  According to the most recent 10-Q report, PACS has an occupancy rate of 94% for all facilities they have managed for more than 18 months.  Based on this: occupancy, revenue and earnings should all greatly improve for the 53 new facilities in upcoming quarters.

A high percentage of new facilities (operated for less than 18 months) indicates greater potential for earnings growth.  Before the acquisition, 65 out of 220 (29%) PACS facilities were new.  Now 118 out of 273 facilities (43%) are new.

Potential labor shortages, and especially skilled labor shortages are important to consider when forecasting how quickly PACS can turnaround the 53 new facilities.  The availability of nurses and other healthcare professionals varies greatly by region.  Rural areas generally have much more difficulty finding and keeping nurses.  

The 53 new facilities are mostly located near major cities like Portland and Seattle. We would expect staffing to be much less of a problem than if they were mostly located in rural areas.  And job openings on PACS careers website backs that up.  I checked openings for as many of the 53 new facilities that I could find.  Total number of openings (including cleaners, meal prep, etc.) at each facility was generally in the single digits.  Nurse openings were mostly around 3 per facility. 

Average total staff at SNFs is 150 to 200 employees and average number of Registered nurses is around 15-20 (according to Meta AI anyway).  So the job openings at the new facilities probably only represent a small portion of total staff.

Only 1 of the 53 facilities appeared to be having great difficulty finding qualified staff: a facility in Carson City Nevada that was offering sign-on bonuses for nurses.  While in many rural areas of the country, sign-on bonuses and other incentives are the norm.  My point is staffing problems are not likely to limit occupancy and earnings growth at the 53 new facilities.

**Facility shortage**

The pandemic caused construction of new facilities to slow dramatically.  First covid increased the death rate, which decreased occupancy directly and also decreased new admissions because facilities were viewed (correctly) as too dangerous.  Then, a severe labor shortage greatly affected the elderly care industry because it is very labor intensive.  Because the elderly care industry was so troubled, investors did not want to risk capital on new construction projects.  And construction still has not recovered, even with the first baby boomers approaching the age of 80.  New facilities construction rate is at its lowest level since 2014. Analysts are now projecting a shortage of 500,000 individual units for the elderly by 2030.  

And that shortage is probably going to be worse than what analysts are currently projecting.  Death rates will be lower because of a herd-thinning effect in 2020-22.  Many more frail people died in those years than normal leaving a relatively more robust population.  USA death rates for the elderly were around 8% lower than expected levels in July.  This lower than expected death rate for the elderly is likely to continue for many months and years.  

Also, dementia rates are increasing because much of the population suffered at least some degree of brain injury from covid.  Here’s what is happening in the UK, where they are tracking the rates: [https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/07/dementia-diagnoses-in-england-at-record-high/](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2024/07/dementia-diagnoses-in-england-at-record-high/)

So both of these factors are going to further strain Elderly care facilities and increase occupancy.  This benefits nursing home operators, like PACS, directly because occupancy rates will increase more quickly.  But it also means medicaid & medicare must keep reimbursement rates high to incentivize the construction and operation of new units.

**Valuation**

PACS revenue growth is very strong at 29.1% and I think this is likely to continue or accelerate due to their new acquisitions.Their earnings growth is a bit difficult to figure out because they just had their IPO and there were a lot of expenses related to that. Net income was $38.2 million in first 6 months of 2024 vs. $58.8 million for first 6 months of 2023.  But if you adjust for the one time expenses (on page 35 of their most recent 10-Q), I get earnings of $124.5million for first 6 months of 2024 vs $62.6 million for first 6 months of 2023.  This gives 98% earnings growth. 

For earnings per share, I get: ($124.5million\*2)/129 million shares = 1.93.  Current price is 40.72 so for trailing PE ratio I get 21.1.  And for PEG ratio: 21.1/98 = 0.21.  So the stock looks incredibly undervalued based on p/e ratio and past earnings growth. And that doesn’t even include the potential of the new acquisitions.

If someone wants to check me on my numbers and math, that would be great! I definitely could have made some mistakes or I could even be completely wrong here so please check me.

The Odd Couple - Waymo & Uber Join Forces,"In the world of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing, a new power couple has emerged: **Waymo** and **Uber.** Once fierce competitors vying for dominance in the autonomous driving space, they have now joined forces in a strategic partnership that has sent ripples through the industry. 

This article will explore this unlikely alliance, analyzing the financial and strategic motivations behind it, the potential benefits and risks for both companies, and the overall impact on the future of transportation

# From Rivals to Partners: A Shift in Strategy

The Waymo-Uber partnership, initially announced in May 2023 and expanded in September 2024, marks a significant shift in strategy for both companies. 

**Uber**, once heavily invested in developing its own autonomous driving technology, has since exited that endeavor and pivoted to a platform-based approach. This partnership allows them to integrate Waymo's proven technology into their ride-hailing app without the substantial R&D costs and risks.

**Waymo**, on the other hand, gains immediate access to Uber's massive user base and operational infrastructure, accelerating the deployment and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service.

# A Look at the Financials

Understanding the financial motivations behind this partnership is crucial.

**Uber**, despite showing strong financial performance in 2023 and early 2024 with 15% revenue growth, a shift to profitability, and strong cash flow generation (revenue of $37.3 billion in 2023 and $10.1 billion in Q1 2024, operating profit of $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.4 billion free cash flow in Q1 2024)^(\[2\]\[4\]), is facing increasing pressure from investors regarding its long-term prospects in the face of autonomous driving disruption^(\[1\]). This partnership allows them to mitigate this risk and position themselves for future growth.

**Waymo**, while not publicly disclosing detailed financials, has received a new $5 billion investment from parent company Alphabet in July 2024, highlighting their continued commitment to the project^(\[3\]). The partnership with Uber offers a faster path to profitability by leveraging Uber's existing infrastructure and customer base, potentially accelerating Waymo's estimated $1.4 billion annual revenue^(\[6\]). Additionally, Waymo's financials are embedded within Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which reported $285 million revenue and $813 million operating loss in Q2 2023 and $365 million revenue and $1.13 billion operating loss in Q2 2024^(\[7\]).

# A Win-Win Situation?

**For Uber:**

* Access to Waymo's advanced AV technology without the associated R&D costs.
* Potential to increase market share by offering autonomous options to their riders.
* Improved operational efficiency and reduced costs in the long term with autonomous vehicles.
* A strategic move to future-proof their business model and remain a leader in the mobility market.

**For Waymo:**

* Rapid expansion and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service through Uber's platform.
* Increased visibility and user adoption of its technology.
* Potential for accelerated revenue growth.

# However, the partnership also presents certain risks:

**For Uber:**

* Dependency risk on Waymo's technology.
* Potential for brand dilution if Waymo's technology encounters issues or negative public perception.
* Risk of cannibalization of its existing ride-hailing business with the introduction of autonomous vehicles.

**For Waymo:**

* Potential conflicts with Uber regarding strategic goals or operational approaches.
* Regulatory scrutiny due to market dominance concerns.
* Limited control over the user experience and branding within the Uber app.

# The Road Ahead

The long-term success of this partnership will hinge on several factors:

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: Navigating the complex and evolving regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles will be crucial.
2. **Public Acceptance**: Overcoming public skepticism and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles will be paramount for widespread adoption.
3. **Competitive Landscape**: The rapid development and deployment of autonomous driving technology by other players like Tesla (whose robotaxi announcement caused Uber's stock to fall 9%) will require both companies to continuously innovate and stay ahead of the curve^(\[4\]) . 

The Waymo-Uber partnership, presents a fascinating case study of how former rivals can adapt and collaborate to navigate technological disruption and shape the future of their industry.

After my first big hit I stumbled down trying to get a foundation for my strategy. Eventually I sat down and locked in, strictly sticking to my plan (for the most part) and staying much more conservative than I was over the course of last month. Mostly stuck to SPY/QQQ calls w/ far out exp. dates

I have proof that the market is NOT gambling. ,"I'm not going to sit here for long and bore you guys to death, but I have been observing a specific area of the market that I think is often overlooked for almost the past year. Upon observing, I've come to realize that dark pool orders serve as the skeletal system of the market. 

Don't believe me? Take a look at this past week on the SPY. I've actually been kicking myself because I only profited off of one side of the move on Wednesday., which was downside where I made 300% playing these orders down to the levels in the screenshot below. 

  
I've blocked out other dark pool orders because they are significantly smaller then these two. 

https://preview.redd.it/f4alxziroood1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=745f28937a51b87d509ced28abc2bebf3a80199d

  


These dark pool orders came in on Friday after the Jobs Report. I've been paying attention to dark pool orders for the past year or so, so my strategy is usually to play the orders to their level on the dark pool. Once price reaches that level, that's my Take Profit. For example, If SPY has untapped orders at 545 and the market price is 548, I'll short SPY to 545 and I exit. 

  
On Wednesday 9-11, SPY opened up at around 549 and instantly sold off to 540. Why? Because these orders from Friday had to be touched. For the QQQ, there was a massive order at 452. So what happens next? QQQ finds support at 452 and SPY finds support at 540. It's not a coincidence, or by accident. These levels are structured throughout stock and everything in between tends to be noise. 

  
I had QQQ puts where I sold QQQ at 452, but I did not have the brain to think to buy calls at the level in this particular instance because I was trying to play it safe. I usually only play to the level because they're not always buy orders. Could have 100X my money playing the other direction, but that's life.

  
Damn, I went too long. I'll stop here. I'm new to Reddit, but if you guys like this I can analyze some dark pool orders in the coming days. ",1640,1726280036.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fgbtyf/i_have_proof_that_the_market_is_not_gambling/

My DD:

* They've expanded their gross margin from 20% to 33% to 44% over the last 3 years, based on increasing subscription revenue
* Operating margin has improved from -76% to -20% over the same time period, due to cost cutting exercises. They're on a trajectory to turn profitable in the next \~1 year. 
* Compared to other retail sport or higher-end hardware companies, their Price:Gross Revenue ratio is really low at 1.44, compared to 5.24, 7.82, and 1.55 for NKE, LULU, and SONO. 
* Nick Caldwell joined the company as the CPO, and he helped get Looker acquired by Google. PTON is a prime acquisition target at the current EV of $3B.
* With almost 700M in cash on hand, with only -66M operating cash flows, PTON can run with \~10 more years at its current levels

Risks:

* Total revenue has dropped from 3.5B to 2.7B 
* Their hardware sales have fallen from 2.2B to only 1B over the past 2 years, which limits the size of their install base. 
* No acquisition, and they aren't able to scale distribution of their hardware to additional customers.

JPM - The father of all banks,"TL;DR: Rate cuts are coming, and guess who's gonna benefit the most? The biggest, baddest bank in the game, JPM. With earnings around the corner, I'm betting big that we see a pre-earnings run-up.

1. Catalyst - Fed Rate Cuts

Rate cuts are generally good for the market but especially good for the financial sector, particularly for big banks like JPM.

2. JPM is the Father of All Banks

They've got their hands in everything: consumer banking, investment banking, asset management, and global markets. This makes them a solid play, especially with Fed cuts coming.

3. Earnings Incoming

JPM’s earnings are set for release on October 13. I’m anticipating a pre-earnings run as more traders pile into JPM expecting strong results. The earnings usually reflect the performance of the sector, and with the market expecting relief from higher interest rates, we could see JPM leading the charge.

Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year',"Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said — in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030. According to the report, published on Sept. 9, the kingdom's $925 billion Public Investment Fund will lead the investment.

My VTLE Position and Reasoning in Solidarity with Regard,"Positions, GIMPed together, $71k cost basis: https://i.imgur.com/sVi5CIM.png

I filtered petroleum stocks by removing natgas corps, corps with high natgas mix, royalty trusts, and high cost production like Canadian oil sands. These are sorted by PE and VTLE is among the best in terms of earnings to stock price.

Their oil fields are in the Permian Basin Texas, a low cost or production region. Shale oil is fracted out. 45% of their oil is below $50/barrel breakeven. 15M barrels of oil hedged through 2025 at $75/barrel. The share price trades < 40% of tangible book value, meaning a larger corp can swallow them up for double the price and still save 20% compared to buying individual oil fields themselves.

The market cap is $1B. They made $700M in 2023 and $600M in 2022. At the current price, the market is saying the management is trash and their reinvestments are trash because for every dollar of earnings they plow back into the company, you can buy it for less than 40 cents.

The company has debt but it's not an insane amount. Debt to equity is 63%. Compare to Buffett's oil darling, OXY at 64%. 

Their recent quarterly earnings are lumpy because their hedges distort their earnings and their large recent purchases are inefficient. They buy shitty operations and make them less shitty.

Cashflows are lumpy because management is aggressive and really push it to the limit but put in guardrails through aggressive hedging so they don't just crash, burn, and die.

And yes, like that other moron keeps spamming, there is a sizeable short percentage on this. 28% short the float. I don't think it's consequential, squeeze these nuts.

They have oil reserves to last something like 10 years, I don't remember. They just need to not die and oil prices to not stay super low for a decade.

There you go, my non regard explanation for why I have a sizeable position. Unlike the other guy, I'm not insane enough to dump 200% of my net worth in it.",10,1726247832.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fg04tj/my_vtle_position_and_reasoning_in_solidarity_with/

$RIVN – Long-Term Potential or Just Another EV Gamble? Seeking Opinions,"I’ve been keeping an eye on Rivian ($RIVN) and wanted to get some thoughts from the community. With Amazon backing them (100,000 electric delivery vans ordered) and rumors of a potential deal with Volkswagen, Rivian seems to have some POTENTIALLY strong momentum behind it. Their focus on electric trucks and SUVs gives them a unique position in the market compared to Tesla's dominance in sedans.

That said, they’ve faced some notable production delays and supply chain issues. On top of that, competition in the EV space is fierce, with major players like Tesla, GM, and Ford pushing into the electric truck/SUV market. 

I'm curious to hear from anyone with more insights: Is Rivian a solid long-term play, or are we looking at bankruptcy? What are your thoughts on their ability to scale production and meet expectations, especially as we head into 2025?

RKLB - Potential Suitors?,"Watched a great Morgan Stanley presentation with the CFO of RKLB last night.  So much to like about the way their business is developing and the level-headed folks running it.  This wasn't part of this presentation, but I spent a good deal of time thinking afterwards about how things might play out for Rocket Lab in the near term.  I wonder if they don't become a target for some company who wants to have an end-to-end, ready-made constellation of communication satellites a la Starlink.   Why not purchase the company that develops, builds, and launches them for relative peanuts; before they really start generating positive revenue and the stock runs up?  

I'm thinking about you, APPLE!  What say you?  Talk amongst yourselves.  Who else might be a natural fit to buy a company like Rocket Lab?  I know APPLE is a left field idea, but heck, they almost went into the auto biz.

Chances of 50 bps rate cut increase to 47%,Leaving a link here to those interested: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-muted-uncertainty-fed-rate-101133976.html,421,1726227030.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ffsehw/chances_of_50_bps_rate_cut_increase_to_47/
Heading into next week,"Last week, exactly when the news was saying to not buy or increase exposure is when I said that it's a good buying opportunity and my other post was deleted (I did sth right or wrote the R word too many times and we are more sensitive nowadays). Lets see if this one gets removed....

So going into next week with the Fed meeting I expect the market to trend sideways or slightly down (SPY around 553-563). Looking at index divergence QQQ definitely experienced sharper drops and is lagging SPY and DIA. For a bullish case into late sept-oct we need to see QQQ catching up, but we could also see a selloff of SPY and DIA, which isn't that great for bulls.

The most likely outcome for a rate cut is 25bp, there could still be a 50bp cut, but I believe the outcome that guarantees smooth sailing into the future months is a 25bp cut and the Fed more or less hinting towards another 2-3 rate cuts later into the year. The 50bp cut will just signal something is wrong with the economy. The no cut scenario might be the worse one, but giving it only a 1% chance since the dual mandate of the Fed involves keeping inflation close to the 2% target and maximum employment. They haven't been doing too great on the employment part so future cuts is the more likely outcome.

I would recommend taking profits if you did buy the lows and waiting it out until after the meeting. Hopefully this will save some of you guys from buying the top (if it pumps before the Fed meeting) or selling the bottom (if it drops too much beforehand). There was some rotation from big money into bond etfs though I'm not sure if the cuts are already priced in or not so this is rather risky unless IV is low and you can play both sides before the announcement. Large insder buys/sells wise I am pretty much seeing only Buffet dump BAC shares either to have cash or rotate into something else. I think banks won't be doing too well if rates go lower, but it should benefit tech, real estate and companies that need to do some debt restructuring. 

I think generally you'll want to take some profits and wait out Wednesday to see the direction. If it's looking bullish then buying dips and holding for longer is gonna be a good plan, if it's looking bearish it's better to buy large dips and then take profits on retracements in the same day.",26,1726223008.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ffrbip/heading_into_next_week/
The strike at Boeing ($BA) is just the start. The next quarterly report will be a mess. Making a small bet in the $120 strike put option,"As you know, Boeing has messed up again, and the ongoing work strike could last another 1-2 months, similar to the automotive strikes. This will likely drain Boeing’s cash flow by at least another $3 billion. Given they’re already operating with negative cash flow, any further bleed will push back their timeline to achieve positive cash flow.

Keep in mind that the upcoming quarterly report is shaping up to be another nightmare for shareholders. The additional red tape in their production process, aimed at improving quality, is only going to slow things down further, leading to more delivery delays and cost increases.

We can expect their losses to widen, cash flow to worsen, and it’s very likely the stock price will drop below $100 after the next quarterly results. So, put it is.

DXCM ~60% drop from all time highs,"Have done a high level assessment of DXCM. I have a small position in DXCM, and will likely DCA if the price drops further.

Additional insights into DXCM and thoughts welcome.

**Company Overview:**

Dexcom (DXCM) is a leader in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which are used primarily by diabetes patients to monitor blood sugar levels in real-time.

**Market Opportunity:**

* **Increase in number of people with diabetes:** Globally, more than half a billion people live with diabetes, with the [IDF](https://diabetesatlas.org/#:~:text=Diabetes%20around%20the%20world%20in%202021%3A,%2D%20and%20middle%2Dincome%20countries) expecting this amount to increase by \~50% over the next 20 years. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/index.html), around 38 million Americans (roughly one in 10) are living with diabetes. One in five are unaware they are diabetic. In the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled.
* **Expansion into Type 2 Diabetes monitoring:** Historically, CGMs have been used primarily for Type 1 diabetes, but there is a potential to provide glucose monitoring to Type 2 diabetes patients, who outnumber Type 1 patients 10:1. Dexcom is starting to make inroads here with the approval of the G7 system for broader use, a key driver of future sales growth.
* **International expansion:** With regulatory approvals outside the US, Dexcom has significant international expansion potential.
* **Customer cost subsidisation:** The increasing insurance reimbursement for CGMs, particularly in the US and Europe, is further reducing the cost burden on patients, accelerating adoption.
* **Overall growth:** With the above, growing awareness of glucose monitoring, increased healthcare access, the CGM market is poised to grow, with some analysts expecting the overall market to increase at a 7% - 12% CAGR over the next 5 - 10 years.

**Fundamentals:**

* **Revenue model:** Dexcom sells consumable sensors which drive predictable and recurring revenue as customers need to replace sensors on a regular basis.
* **Revenue growth:** Dexcom's revenue has grown \~20% year-over-year, on a trailing 12 month basis, which is in line with the past 3 years. Management have reduced their full year 2024 guidance to 11% - 13% due to poor sales execution, partly driven by disruption from a sales force expansion (which I expect is a short term factor).
* **Margins:** Margins appear to be improving year on year. Management are forecasting improved EBITDA margins at \~29% (\~4% increase on prior year), which should accelerate Free Cashflow Growth.
* **Ratios:** After the recent decline in stock price, DXCM's Price to Sales, Price to Free Cashflow and Price to Earnings are close to Abbott's (competitor) ratios, despite the DXCM having higher and more consistent revenue growth, higher margins and higher cashflow growth.

**Risks:**

* **Competitive threats:** The CGM market is very competitive with companies like Abbott investing heavily in CGM technology. A technological breakthrough from competitors could impact DXCM’s sales.
* **GLP-1 medication:** Various GLP-1 medication (e.g. Mounjaro / Zepbound, Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus),  have shown effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss, which could decrease the demand for Dexcom's CGM devices. Despite this, CGM systems may still be required by many diabetes patients in order to monitor their glucose levels, especially those requiring precise monitoring, so the overall market for CGMs may remain strong.
* **Technological obsolescence:** Various tech companies are / are rumoured to be looking into non-invasive glucose monitoring through watches and rings. I can't find anything in testing with the FDA and nothing has been approved by the FDA. Standard review time by the FDA is [10 months](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs).",8,1726220149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ffqn2k/dxcm_60_drop_from_all_time_highs/

OpenAI Released a New Model GPT-o1 That Only Allows 35 Messages Per Week Because It Thinks - It Also Hasn't Been Trained With All Data,"Ladies and Gentleman there cannot be a larger buy signal than this. The fact that this model requires so much power it has to be limited to 35 messages per week is incredible. I am driving this one point because it is a clear throughput situation. 

Also, the information cutoff is October 2023 which tells me this isn't the new massive model they are releasing. So, what does this all mean? 

It means they released a new capability which uses much more compute but isn't technically perhaps their new monster model that is trained on trillions of parameters. If this was a new model I would expect the cutoff date to be much more recent. At least 3-6 months would have made more sense. Now, there is time between training and cutoff time but I don't think they've been sitting with a model that has been trained for over a year ago. A newer, more recent model must be sitting there for use but can't. 

What this all suggest to me is that they are currently massively GPU constrained at the moment and waiting desperately for Blackwell. What you would expect is massively more throughput for GPT-o1 and you eventually have to expect a newer more massive model that is fundamentally better at the core. 

Joanne Jang from OpenAI tweeted this. 

>""There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch—but we're working to get there!""

OpenAI also said they are adding additional tools later. 

So in effect, they released a new engineering marvel with model actionability/capabilities i.e. thinking - in preparation for adding a massively more capable model + new thinking capability later. It's going to be a 1, 2 punch that I don't think the world is ready for. 

The 35 messages per week is a throughput drop I could not have imagined. This is what Jensen was talking about that people are getting emotional. 

The amount of GPU spend from the new AGI race that is about to ensue is going to be insane.

Short Wells Fargo to finance expenses on the Bilt credit card through them.,"Wells Fargo has this credit card program with great rewards, which they're losing billions of dollars on. How it worked was Bilt was founded by some conman who convinced bank executives giving a card with $0 in sign up fees, and high reward rates would make them money. They would have made money if account holders carried a balance, but almost no one is doing that.

They're trying to get out of the deal, but still have seven more years of it, and it looks like they're trapped contractually. 

So, something like 6 million new people get Bilt cards, and use a Wells Fargo short position to finance their yearly expenses on it. I don't know, but I bet all of us using a credit card for all expenses, which Wells Fargo loses large sums of money on might be bad for the share price.

VTLE - Fundamental Analysis Discussion,"In my opinion, it’s an interesting play (and should be discussed, why do the mods ban this).

$1.33B ebitdax as of end of Q2 with only $1.60B net debt for minimal leverage.

Production is largely hedged for the next 12 months, so there’s plenty of optionality for oil curve to lift while the company keep clipping money from production.

At $1B equity value, enterprise value is now around 2x EBITDAX which is insanely low, even though the oil curve has since plummeted.

Compared to all similar $1-5B oil and gas companies, the equity and enterprise value have dropped far further, likely because a key holder has been liquidating.

Upside if oil pops back next 6 months is over 100% return back to $55 but in the meantime, even a return to the $30’s is a 30-50% return which is possible at these levels of oil price.

Oil is still extremely cheap in the face of 50-60% inflation of all other goods. I’m bullish on oil as well.

- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. 
Id also like to add an investment piece they have “We have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.”

They have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.

Boeing to launch space-based quantum demo in 2026,"Highlights:

• planned launch in 2026

• U.S. government spends about $1 billion each year on quantum development through its National Quantum Initiative

$BA is obviously still troubled by a variety of horrors, culminating in their last 5 years resulting in a -57.30% drop in the stock price. The idea that they have a plan for an initiative that will be taking 1 -  2 years to complete, is kind of astonishing to be honest.

Henrik Zeberg: S&P500 to decline to 1800 in a few years,"Henrik Zeberg has argued that the stock market is in for a massive decline in the coming years. He expects a blow off top to happen in the coming months with the S&P500 reaching 6100 to 6300, and then to go down sharply. There will be a deep recession and the FED will do QE again in a big way, leading to a big bounce in the economy and the stock market. But then inflation will tick up again and the stock market will start to slide down. He then expects the S&P500 to bottom out at around 1800 in a few years from now. 

I think this sort of a scenario is very plausible. The stock market is enormously overvalued, it has gone up a lot relative to the economy via multiple expansion. Traders are mostly making realized profits off the losses of their fellow traders, the inflows from the real economy are very low. The value of the portfolios of investors is mostly just unrealizable phantom wealth. 

It's as if you have a big insolvent bank whose clients are happy to put their money in a savings account with that bank, because they don't believe the bank is insolvent and the bank pays every account holder 10% interest per year. The bank doesn't have that money, it just issues account statements displaying the 10% interest payment, 

The wise thing to do if you have an account at such a bank, is to pull your money out before it is too late. And given that the bank is insolvent, it's als a given that only a fraction of the account holders will ever be able to pull their money out.

What do you guys think about Micron before their Sept earnings?,"Their stock has dropped considerably since the highs. This despite that earnings results were not that bad.

Their (1yr) Forward P/E ratio is now absolute rock bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/s706gocmmeod1.png?width=2298&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1feafac3c75c116bd98c7198c4c71411be1bca

The bear case for them is that they are investing too much in production capacity. This is odd considering how backed up they are in terms of supplying DRAMs. 

An additional bear case is that their profit margins were low \~11%.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins)

But this seems to be cyclic (they have always been). Their traditional profit margins have averaged around 40%, which is a pretty decent number. The fact that they invested in manufacturing capacity to meet the demand, kind of explains the lower margins in the last quarter.

Given all this, why is Micron not a solid buy before the Sept 27th earnings? What am I missing?

Disclosure: I do have a small position (\~200 stocks, which is down 30%). But I wonder, why this is not a time to load up on some options?

Guess what? I just loaded some $INTC Intel Put yesterday. ,"Yeah, I’ve been thinking the same thing—who shorts Intel when it's already at rock bottom? I’ve been mulling over this for the past week, and my gut says to going long since the stock has dropped over 30%. Plus, all the bad news about the upcoming quarterly results should be mostly priced in by now.

But after digging into it, I don’t think Intel’s troubles are over. They’ve been losing ground in the mobile and AI markets, and the competition in the PC processor space is brutal. The CEO is doing his best to turn things around, but big changes like selling off unprofitable segments (like Altera or Mobileye) or spinning off their foundry—if the rumors are true—won’t happen overnight. Meanwhile, they’re still burning cash in these areas.

On top of that, Intel’s dealing with chip defects and warranty costs are going to be hurt. Their Meteor Lake production is facing bottlenecks, and while they’ve launched Lunar Lake, it’s too early to tell how sales will go. Plus, the export ban to China is another blow to their revenue.

Honestly, Intel’s starting to feel like the Boeing of the chip world—too big to fail but too slow to make a quick turnaround. I think we’re looking at a couple more ugly quarters ahead. So put it is, sorry Nana

$CELH - Looking Interesting at current levels,"I build a simplistic model on CELH. With reasonable assumptions of:

* Annual Revenue growth post 2024 between 15-20%
* GM expanding to 53.5%
* Operating leverage kicking in 

EPS can get to 1.8/share by 2028. At a forward multiple of 30x, the stock could trade between 50-55 by end 2027 creating a 65% upside. The downside does look limited from here

Key to watch is the Gross margin profile over next two quarters as revenue decelerates. The stock could be under pressure in short term.

Does anyone have any strong views on this franchise's inability to grow revenues above mid teen levels post 2024 (The 2024 bump from NIKE inventory adjustment is in the consensus numbers)

SOUN (SoundHound AI) is insanely overvalued ,"Company has a $1.74B market cap on only ~$54M of annualized revenue…an insane ~32x revenue multiple.

Now if SOUN was some sort of revolutionary category defining company…maybe I could get on board. But it’s just mostly a customer service/customer experience tool…not even particularly differentiated at that. Plenty of competition in the AI sound and voice recognition space.

Now granted it’s growing much faster than your typical public SaaS company at ~54% YoY…but that’s easy when revenue is only around $50M. No way that growth rate is sustainable for this business. 

The 8-12x revenue multiple range is where SOUN market cap should be right now…I have a feeling we’ll see it there sometime not too far off in the future.

Hear me out... It's Macy's ($M) 🛍️,"I know what you're thinking— Macy’s? Really? The department store my grandma shops at? Before you scroll, hear me out guys. There’s a lot  going on with this stock that a lot of people are sleeping on, take a closer look below and let me know what you think...

# 💰 1. That Dividend Though... 💰

Let’s start with the **dividend**. Macy’s has a **dividend yield over 4%** right now. It’s sitting at $0.165 per share, which is pretty solid in the grand scheme of the market. While most companies have been cutting dividends  Macy’s have been paying consistently since they brought it back post-Covid. 

The ex-dividend date is coming up on September 13 BTW. Pays out October 1st.

# 🏦 2. Macy’s is Not Broke, Far From It 🏦

From all the public statements Macy’s has been cleaning up its balance sheet. They’ve been aggressively paying down debt and have over **$1 billion in cash**. They're closing underperforming stores and cutting costs which I'm sure led to some antiquated bloat. They’ve pivoted hard into e-commerce (probably forced at gunpoint to), which now makes up almost 40% of their sales. 

# 🏢 3. REAL ESTATE 🏢

Here’s something a lot of people don’t realize—**Macy’s owns an insane amount of real estate**. The store at **Herald Square in NYC alone is** worth a fortune. Macy’s has been sitting on some prime real estate for years, and there are rumors they co**uld sell or spin off s**ome of these properties. They’ve already sold some assets before, like their San Francisco Men’s store alone for $250 million.

# 🔥 4. Super Undervalued Right Now 🔥

Here’s the kicker: Macy’s is trading at a **P/E ratio of 4.8**. For those not familiar that is super low for a company that’s still quite profitable. 

Wall Street is underestimating them. Earlier this year, there were **buyout offers for Macy’s at $24.80 a share**, but the stock is currently sitting around **$13/14** or so. That’s a huge gap, and you'd have to think that if any buyout talks reignite or they start unlocking their real estate value, Macy’s stock surge back up quickly.

Is this considered insider trading, lets say coca cola for example i have a privileged information that either coca cola or any brand is about to crash or have a really bad report regarding its health effects on people or, anything that could hurt them, but lets say you use that information not to sell, nor go short on the stock, but however buy stock from a competitor, lets say Pepsi, that could be really benefited with the downfall of Coca Cola. Could this be considered insider trading or not. ",3,1726089503.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1felgkq/can_this_be_considered_insider_trading/

Sold higher near market close but didn't have time to screenshot that one

Now I'm regretting I didn't buy more but well profit is profit and I'm happy that I timed that low pretty damn accurate.
