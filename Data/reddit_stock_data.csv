wallstreetbets,8 reason to YOLO $NIO today,"Alright, guys. Consider this a follow-up to my last NIO post. I bought some Nio call earlier and its printing, I’m selling off some of my other holdings to ride this trend when the market opens.

https://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255

It might sound crazy, but hear me out—here are 8 reasons why I’m YOLO-ing into NIO right now:

**Fed cutting rates** – The Fed’s already cutting, and they’re likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don’t fight the Fed*—when they cut, the market goes up.

**China stimulus** – The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index—stocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won’t be short because China’s economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn’t even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.

**Chinese economy recovery** – Like I said, this isn’t a short-term bull. It’ll probably last a year or two. China’s economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I’ve seen posts from Chinese forums—some people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.

**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** – Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you’ll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.

**NIO is even cheaper** – NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It’s been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month’s price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO’s sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.

**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** – The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it’s a piece of cake.

**NIO’s next two earnings are going to be huge** – They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.

**A turning point is coming** – If 0nvo’s sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they’ll scale production and cut costs. They’re also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about here.

wallstreetbets,10 stacks on CAT calls to run up before earnings,"Caterpillar (CAT) reports earnings between the 25th and the 30th, with most estimates being the 29th. (They haven't announced the date yet.) I bought 7x NOV 1 CALL 390 contracts to profit from a run-up in IV.

Based on my model of historical pre-earnings IV, even if CAT stays flat or dips a little bit, these options should move up in price. They're at 29.8% IV right now, with vega of 0.46 and theta 0.24. Here's a monte carlo simulation, where the horizontal axis is number of days remaining until earnings are released.

https://preview.redd.it/2r8tpd0z1zrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=907aa6ffabe68795bd4938e63c9e659a4aa1ae03

From top to bottom, the red lines are the 90th percentile, mean (expected value), 10th percentile, and 1st percentile of the expected contract price. Because of the way that IV increases as earnings get closer, the distribution of daily log-returns of the stock, and the relative values of vega and theta, I think it's likely that the price increase from delta and IV will outpace the price drop from theta.

I think the stock will rise over the next few weeks as folks prep for earnings, because:

* They've been giving conservative guidance this year, which has been accurate re: revenue and customer inventories, but they are still outperforming in terms of profit.
* Forecasters have consistently underestimated CAT EPS, so they consistently post an EPS beat.
* Only one of their major competitors reports in the next couple weeks, so there's little risk of a big shock to the stock price. The rest of their competitors all report around the same time they do.
* The fed rate cut and pre-election favorable oil prices may soon increase customer heavy equipment purchases, as customer purchase and operating costs will be down.
* The stock market often runs up prior to an election, so the overall trend should be up.
* CAT also has a strong drift component this year, so there's not much reason to expect a drop.

I'm planning to hold for the next few weeks, taking profit at +25% or loss at -25%. If IV doesn't rise to 30% over the next two weeks I'll probably close no matter what.

wallstreetbets,Lamb Weston Earnings Play,"So $LW - Lamb Weston was scheduled to release Q1 earnings tomorrow morning, but now it looks like it may be delayed by a day.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and say it is likely a third quarter of shitty results in a row. To begin with, never a good sign if the call gets delayed.

But the real reasons are much more tangible. Lamb Weston Meijer, their huge European venture was for a very, very long time a 50/50 joint venture so their activity never flowed into results, so when they had a bad year it didn't really matter. They bought it out a couple years ago now. This is relevant because in Europe a very significant amount of the processing potatoes are not contracted, farmers sell them open in the market...and this summer prices were near record highs all season. This means their COGS in Europe are likely super high. There have been shortages of potatoes in Europe and a lot of the crop has had issues driving the price up. In addition it sounds like seed potatoes aren't great meaning they likely have to forecast higher costs for those.

In the US, most of their business is contracted for 1-2 years. So they lost a lot of business when they fucked up their ERP, and it is unlikely they would have gained much of any of that back by now. They had to pick up other business through heavy discounting, and I would expect that to continue. Especially since this has been dubbed the ""summer of value"" for all the big quick serve restaurants, and regular restaurant traffic has declined per recent results.

They had some kind of epic fuck up with McDonald's Korea, which drove the chain to stop selling fries in the entire country for like 2 weeks. They disclosed this event in the last earnings call, but it is possible as  the fallout continues there will be additional costs, because it had to be very serious.

Their retail division seems to have given up. It was one of their biggest drivers of growth through covid. Now, they have increased competition and aren't doing anything. Simplot effectively bought Ore-Ida and has revitalized that brand, and McCain (the largest fry producer) has entered into many retail spaces in the US, both of these companies have been discounting to gain market share. Lamb launched their Grown in Idaho brand like 5 years ago to be a middle tier product, now with others discounting, it is one of the most expensive. They also seem to have lost lots of freezer space.

Their ERP upgrade is still likely going on and draining more money. This may end up being just about the most money any company has ever shelled out for one when you look at cost to market Cap.

They have a plant in South America, which has also seen a potato crisis, much worse than Europe. So that facility is probably bleeding money. They were also building out a new huge facility expansion, but to put it in perspective their most recent China plant got delayed well beyond their initial schedule, how the hell do you think it is going to go in Argentina. I'd expect that will be delayed quite a bit because nothing happens fast there, period. Delayed = more expensive. And honestly no idea what kind of moron thinks buying a business in Argentina, which is in competition for the worst economy of the century in the world, is a great deal...and then to double down. CEO must have had some bad advice.

At this point one of the biggest hindrances appears to be the C-Suite. It looks like the CEO has never had to manage failure, and is hapless and unable to course correct...because this is a long time now and there has been no real plans it seems apart from hoping things get better.

Definitely getting puts, not as much as I have previously. But will look to see how things sit at the end of the day. It is possible they pull out a win because they have proved their ability to forecast is dog shit.

French fries good, bad management equals puts

**The Core of the Thesis**

I believe Centrus Energy Corp (LEU) offers the greatest upside in the Nuclear sector. Here’s why:

- LEU is the only American company that enriches uranium today.

- It currently trades at 2.2x enterprise value / sales. It reported 189m of revenues last quarter.

Lets compare that valuation to the uranium miners. Of the one’s producing revenue, they average \~97x. If we reduce the comparison to the lowest, it is 10x. If you want to compare to the largest and most well-known, it is CCJ at 11x. Suffice to say, nuclear-related companies trade at very high multiples.

Maybe they should be trading more in like with utilities with nuclear exposure. Well even here, the average is 5x.

 The basic metrics for LEU and comparisons are below.

https://preview.redd.it/8lff6y73tzrd1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=14eb43fc2ce5763e231a34873cd3699ce9869a58

**Potential for Outsized Returns**

If LEU simply re-rates to \~5x – which to me, would still be very conservatively valued – it would be \~123 / share. January 80 strikes currently trade at \~1.7. If that re-rate happened before then, the return would be \~25x. I.e. (123 – 80) / 1.7.

Those kind of potential returns are exceptionally rare, even among contracts.

I am not aware of any other nuclear related trades that could offer such an enormous return. Never mind such an enormous return on a relatively conservative premise, i.e. re-rating from \~2.2 ev / sales to 5x.

So now that we have the most important elements out of the way, here is why I think Nuclear will be super hot, and more details on LEU specifically.

 

**US Nuclear Bull Thesis**

AI is viewed by the Mag7-Military-Inudustial complex as being central to US political and economic hegemony. As such, they have pulled out all stops in terms expenditures. And the feds have operated at breakneck spread to buttress US advantage in AI via regulation. I.e. they have acted swiftly and aggressively to being as much of the supply chain within US national borders or control.

As AI has progressed, anything that has been revealed to be a bottleneck – whether semis, or data centers with ready powers supplies, or electrical companies, etc. has re-rated, often doubling, tripling, or more in breakneck speed.

The latest revealed bottleneck is energy. And apparently nuclear power is the only source that can viably satiate the projected energy needs. Hence the MSFT big for three mile island. I view this as the opening salvo. The other big AI players will need to secure nuclear sites in short order – perhaps they will be bidding against one another – given the limited number of existing nuclear sites. The news cycle for Nuclear is primed to get wild, and fast.

[From Centrus Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/h324mgwptzrd1.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e41640e6343ace47c1ead089327134cee30923ee)

**LEUs role**

The US’s largest vulnerability with respect to nuclear is that much of the supply chain is controlled by Russia. Given that (a) we are engaged with a proxy war with Russia, and (b) rapidly expanding nuclear power is now a major national security issue – I expect the Feds to act rapidly and decisively to remedy this issue.

The most obvious step to remedy this would be to provide substantial funding to support LEU’s expansion of enrichment facilities within the US. When it comes to acting decisively and rapidly – the Feds almost always bet big on the most established players with the longest history. That is unambiguously LEU.

Beyond the feds taking action, I think the Mag7 / utilities are going to be placing massive orders to secure future enriched uranium, as it becomes evident the number of active nuclear sites in the US is set to expand. LEU should be a recipient of much of these orders and see their backlog increase substantially. In sum, I think LEU is primed for a series of very positive press releases and generally a very bullish news cycle with respect to nuclear energy.

**Further Info**

There is plenty of other reasons to be bullish LEU, e.g. their strong relationships with SMR developers and the work they are doing with HALEU. However, I will end it here. If there is interest, I'll do a follow-up post. In the meantime if you want to dive further

wallstreetbets,why the economy is doomed. A samsclub paper towel perspective.,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this due diligence on the economy.

Over the last 4 years I have gone to my local samsclub to purchase paper towels over 800 times. every week for 4 years, I purchased a 12 pack of bounty select a size paper towel. 

During covid paper towel like toilet paper became a rare resources. It was not guarenteed that the economy could produce enough to sustain the paper towel needs of the citizens. This lead to the terrible pratice of hoarding paper towl and while sad, was very bullish for the economy in general.

After witnessing this sad pratice of hoarding I began to realise that the broader market could be tracked (in generalities) by following how much paper towel my local sams club could keep in stock. I keep track of this number by creating an acronym for these amounts of paper towel stored on pallets at the previously mentioned club. 

S.P.T.P Sams club paper towel pallets. (by creating this acronym I have saved not only myself time while writing, but also you time while reading)

Back during the covid days my local samsclub rarely had more than 2 s.p.t.p delivered a week. buying paper towel was hit or miss. As the economy recovered this increased to a more reliable 4 s.p.t.p.

Now we come to the crux of this post. s.p.t.p remained steady in the 2 to 10 range for the last 3 or so years. Untill this very week. I counted over 45 s.p.t.p on rakes strewn throughout the store. Which leads me (and you if you have even an average IQ) to 1 conclusion. 

No one has extra money to buy paper towel anymore. The economy is toast. Over. To say the world is ending is not even one tiny bit of an exageration.

On monday I will sell every asset I own and fullport into week puts on whatever sector produces paper towels. 

I hope you have the sense to follow this amazing play to prevent ultimate finacial ruin to me (and you)

Thanks again for reading. Best of luck out there.

wallstreetbets,IonQ ($IONQ) DD: Summary of IonQ's Presentation and a Reflection on the Roadmap. Why I believe calls will print after the next earnings.,"# The Introduction

https://preview.redd.it/o6qy9qz6trrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=8609a76921232ad0ea1f905003931eab7b1adebb

IonQ will announce an application that can be run on their upcoming hardware during their next earnings call in November. I think that the announcement will make calls print for weeks to come. In this article I'll be going over why I have come to that conclusion after listening to the company [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rHLtBP04aY) at the Quantum World Congress 2024.

IonQ's Peter Chapman started the talk titled 'Building a Large Global Quantum Business' by giving updates on the business side, while Dean Kassmann would talk later about the technical milestones achieved.

# Business update

# Exponential development rate of QC tech

Chapman started the talk with a surprising insight: ""First, I want to say that I think quantum is accelerating much faster than most people thought it would.

""Contrary to many opinions expressed on Reddit, YouTube, and across social media regarding the maturity of the quantum industry, experts generally agree that 'real' useful solutions are at least 10 years away.

Having Chapman, the CEO of arguably the leading quantum company, assert that the development and deployment of quantum computers are occurring much faster than anticipated presents a clear contradiction. Either the experts in quantum computing and physics are correct in their collective estimates, or IonQ's management is advancing quantum technology faster than expected.

There is a clear gray area in the debate concerning the realistic timeline for bringing advantageous quantum computing systems to market.

# Scaling IonQ to $1 Billion

https://preview.redd.it/n402o09vtrrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7203b71a6dc70188688cbf389b8f5ef3d423d55

Chapman continues by stating that the business part of the presentation will focus on the topic of 'scaling a quantum computing company to reach $1 billion.

# A brief history

""In 1995, IonQ had its breakthrough when Chris Monroe and others developed the very first quantum logic gates. This initial breakthrough led to a seed round 10 years later, marking the beginning of the company.

From 2016 to 2021, we raised two additional VC rounds and created multiple versions of hardware (five generations) in an academic setting. During this time, quantum physicists assembled these systems at the IonQ laboratory. I believe the following gives great insight into the company culture and vision of its people. Business analysts, take note:'

When I joined the company, there was no intention of… The board told me, “Don’t worry about selling systems, and don’t worry about the competition; just build the best hardware.” And that’s what we did.'

With this mentality, the first IonQ roadmap was built.""

# From an academic setting to production

https://preview.redd.it/xczuxnlztrrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=129f337aa56236a347edd307052a4d85ddf2227c

""Even without sales, IonQ had significant luck at that time by raising money, which later allowed the company to transition from academic systems to engineering and building 'real' quantum products.

The shift from the academic phase to the engineering phase required IonQ to think creatively about how to build the product. IonQ began hiring people with backgrounds in product development and large-scale sales. A manufacturing plant was established in Seattle, enabling in-house assembly based on engineering drawings.

'We reached a great milestone; quantum computers built at IonQ are not assembled by physicists, as we want them focused on next-generation systems rather than assembly line work.'""

# Always 3 generations ahead in systems

Having this system designed, where one part of the staff focuses exclusively on creating next-generation products, really makes me think about Tencent.

$TCEHY has divided its team into two groups: one group consists of developers who create the games sold to gamers, while the other comprises financial officers who aim to invest that newly acquired capital and generate returns. This approach seems to be a gold standard across great high-margin businesses. 🤔

# Scaling out to focus internationally

“When you start to ship products, you need to scale your sales team internationally and build a field service organization to support the machines you just sold in places like Japan.

And can you break your machine down into parts, put it into containers, and ship it across the world?

These are the little details that most people don’t consider in quantum, according to Chapman. IonQ’s advantage lies in their preparedness for every small detail and their ability to work several generations ahead into the future.”

# Sales and revenue numbers

""IonQ is approaching $100 million in bookings this year, which shows that 'quantum' is indeed a viable business. We've achieved this in record time—going from $0 to $100 million in bookings in just four years.

https://preview.redd.it/qegvhzx7urrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03ecb0962b78b7bfa45ab6cdf23191bdea1a3a8

  
If you look up how long it took the largest companies to reach $100 million, you'll find that it took Microsoft about 10 years to achieve that milestone. Microsoft was founded in 1975, and in 1985 they had [surpassed](https://archive.org/details/01-microsoft-annual-reports/Microsoft%20Corp%20%28MSFT%29%20Annual%20Report%2C%201986/page/n21/mode/2up?view=theater) that number in annual revenue.""

https://preview.redd.it/hqos14g9urrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3fb595bae2b3d93f8ab68c4cfd6889f96867a7e

While realized revenue and bookings are not the same, and it took Microsoft 10 years to reach that revenue, achieving $100 million in bookings in just four years is still an impressive accomplishment for IonQ.

# Getting to $1B in revenue: IonQ's plan

Chapman continued: ""You need to have international sales, and you're also going to need an application that can deliver value and be used by Fortune 1000 companies, hopefully across entire industries, which can generate $100 billion in revenue on its own.""

""And in fact, at the upcoming earnings call, we will discuss the first of many applications that we believe will be enabled by our upcoming hardware. So it's a really exciting time because we're approaching a place in the Noisy intermediate-scale quantum ([NISQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_intermediate-scale_quantum_era)) era that can deliver that value ($100B).""

This is next-level thinking. Here are three key points:

1. Chapman believes that this application will be used industry-wide, indicating a broad solution that multiple parties can benefit from.
2. He suggests that it could be worth $100 billion on its own.
3. This is linked to international sales, as going international is a requirement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, alongside having a strong application. Shipping an app worldwide as part of a package with their hardware, already indicated to be ready for production, with detailed planning for assembly, shipping, and support teams—makes an international approach sensible.

https://preview.redd.it/d23yorocurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c1486067137dc72d4a1a1c458847d8cc4d72db

Chapman continues to refer to the large number of quantum hardware systems required to achieve $1 billion in sales. ""If you're going to generate $100 billion and you need 50 computers, you better be able to manufacture those 50 machines. And the cost per Qubit better be much lower than it is today.""

""A secret hiding in plain sight is that to scale up to a billion dollars, you have to scale all the other parts of your business, not just the hardware. I think that IonQ is unique in that this is exactly what we're doing right now.""

Consider their strategic approach of working on several future generations at once, planning months ahead, and their efforts to become a software company as well. This strategy facilitates [easy access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv0kHl8imEE&t=406s) to their hardware by integrating drivers from all their competitors. I believe IonQ's team has been extremely busy over the past few months.

In preparation for international sales, IonQ has been focused on delivering results, and now we’re starting to see the details of their work.

# A paradigm shift, coming next earnings call

""We're scaling up manufacturing for the application that will require tens, if not hundreds, of quantum computers.""

Wait a minute. This is it. Every time I listen to this presentation, I keep discovering new insights. Peter Chapman just mentioned that this upcoming application will need 10 to 100 quantum hardware systems. What kind of application could be so impactful that it requires this many systems, more powerful than supercomputers?

I believe this is the industrial paradigm shift we've all been waiting for. An [announcement](https://investors.ionq.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx) regarding this program is expected on November 11th.

https://preview.redd.it/jy7yuiglurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d80861428363add86e4d706fa6e1ab8ff02fee0

# Technical achievements

Dean Kassman took over from Peter Chapman to shift focus and discuss the milestones achieved.

""Peter has talked about enterprise-grade solutions; I’m going to discuss performance and some aspects of physical scale.""

""Our North Star is a balanced approach among the following components:""

https://preview.redd.it/w86vuupnurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec93583c73ffe8d8dae291c6f13f5e322fa546b2

# Commercial advantage through the right choices

IonQ's management believes that achieving their goal of becoming a $100 billion quantum enterprise requires three key components.

""Scale is our North Star. We build it through both modularity and all other engineering best practices we have in place. The key contributors to scale are the ability to connect Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) together.""

""QPUs in a single machine (trapped ions) start as a linear chain in our architecture and evolve into multi-core systems. They then transition from multi-core to connected multi-cores.""

Path: Trapped Ions > Multi-Core > Connected Multi-Cores.

[This is based on the same principle as NVLink, which connects GPUs together.](https://preview.redd.it/320nckqpurrd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5204ba58c921ef1b4849ee038c465fb99579e520)

# Quantum network effects

""We have discussed a set of milestones in our overall path to connecting QPUs:

https://preview.redd.it/pym8w7asurrd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0f5ec292b3704263481713a3310fe922613d24

That slide begins with an analogy to local area networks. It starts with a single point, then progresses to point-to-point connections, and eventually leads to many-to-one connectivity.

We've highlighted four milestones here, but there are many more we can include to provide additional context. The beauty of what we're doing is that it doesn't require any changes to the architecture.

Operating effectively in a room-temperature setting (even though data centers tend to be a bit cooler) is ideal, as it allows the world to adopt IonQ's systems without needing to alter their environments.""

# In Full Forte: IonQ's keys to high performance

""IonQ's barium bet is paying off. 'We have been making continuous progress on our barium technology. This validates the overall approach we have taken with our development systems as we move toward Tempo.

''Tempo has been in the works for a while, and our advancements in barium demonstrate the viability of our technical path as we continue to deliver.'""

# Closing remarks

""We're really excited to share the path we're on and welcome you to learn more about our systems. Thank you for your attention.""

As we see the dollar weaken, and USA rates go down, it is a reasonable play.  We are already seeing China pop on the stimulus news.

  
Seems like the timing is right, and EEM is a reasonable place to start. Seems like we are just getting started and there is a fair about of upside to the trade. Would wait for some pullback before starting a position.

Before you say *ah shit here we go again with another regard screaming ""recession""* let me preface by saying I'm still bullish on the market in the near term.

Here I present to you one of the charts of all time. Those squiggly lines in blue show the confidence spread of smart money to retail. Think of it like this, institutions (aka smart money) are long term investors that are greedy when retail is fearful and fearful when retail is greedy, which here means that peaks are when smart money is calling the bottom and buying and valleys are where only retail is playing. In other words, a trough signals a reversal is likely in the near future and the market is too expensive.  
  
Now if you look carefully you'll see smart money isn't always successful at calling the top and if retail continues to buy strongly they eventually FOMO back in. But in places where the graph has dropped into a trough rapidly, a downturn follows. We have some time before smart money confidence bottoms but we're likely not too far away.

A few things I've noticed on the market that support this theory:  
1. Volumes have been lower recently, which could mean retail activity is the dominant force in the market right now  
2. Soft landing is not a guarantee although the odds are alright for now, but retail is euphoric about it and we're heading into extreme greed  
3. Smart money may be risk-off till after the election  
4. Valuations are insane right now. Banks, energy, some pharma, and telecom are the only sectors not overvalued to the tits in the S&P 500

wallstreetbets,Part 2: Archer Aviation is a Table Pounding Buy as the Grizzly Research Report Caused Over ~27% Short - Dare I say I stand with Cathie Wood,"I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1for7pv/the_time_has_come_for_archer_aviation_achr_evtol/) wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

When nobody else believes I like to find the things worth believing in.

Archer Aviation is worth believing in. Adam Goldstein quite simply is getting shit done. He's just executing and has the perfect partners in United Airlines and the U.S. Military starting with deliveries to the USAF.

In the search for more information, I needed to see what the bear case was against Archer Aviation and Joby to see who the hell was causing such a massive short-interest float in these stocks. I needed to study the bear cases and see if they were correct in their thesis.

First, let's talk about the bears and in this case there are two, Kerrisdale Capital and Grizzly Research. Kerrisdale Capital to the shots at Joby Aviation and Grizzly set it sights on Archer Aviation causing a \~19% and \~22% short  in the eVTOL startups respectively.

Since we're here to talk about Archer I will focus on the short report from Grizzly but I will say the same thesis can be made against Kerrisdale as they are largely the same troupe's such as, ""outlook for profitability as ‘delusional’"" or ""Joby will be a historical footnote"" or Grizzly's ""Archer Aviation is a Lame Duck"" or “metaphoric crash landing”.

Harsh words from institutions that are taking a position to drive the stock down. Let's see what Grizzly's thesis is, the date of the thesis, and what has changed in reality since that thesis was written.

[Grizzly's article you can read for yourself](https://grizzlyreports.com/we-believe-archer-aviation-inc-nasdaqachr-is-a-lame-duck/) but here are the main points (We Believe Archer Aviation, Inc is a Lame Duck - August 15, 2023):

1. **Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s **DoD contract** was portrayed as a major win, leading to a 40% stock jump. However, Grizzly argues that this was a **noncompetitive, indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract**, with only **$1.3 million in potential revenue for 2023**, far less significant than portrayed.
   * **Reference**: ""DoD contracts ACHR received... is capped at $1.3m total revenue in 2023.""
2. **Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Claim**: Archer claimed to be conducting daily test flights, but Grizzly’s investigation found only a **handful of flights**, likely staged for special events. Grizzly accused Archer of recycling old video footage to exaggerate progress.
   * **Reference**: ""Our investigators visited ACHR’s flight testing facilities... reported seeing only a handful of flights.""
3. **Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Claim**: Archer’s partnerships with **United Airlines** and **Stellantis** were secured by giving out millions of shares and warrants for little compensation, misleading investors into thinking these partnerships were more significant.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR has bought credibility through partnerships... Archer awarded millions of shares for questionable or no compensation.""
4. **FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Claim**: Grizzly consulted with FAA experts who estimated that Archer would not receive **Type Certification** for its Midnight aircraft until at least **2028**, not 2024 as Archer claimed.
   * **Reference**: ""FAA experts... estimated... 2028 was a very optimistic estimate.""
5. **Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Claim**: Archer settled a legal dispute with **Wisk/Boeing** by giving **$100 million in free shares** to Boeing, despite announcing the settlement as a success, diluting shareholders and undermining Archer’s autonomy technology claims.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR dished out $100M in free warrants for a $12,000,000 investment by Boeing.""
6. **Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Claim**: Archer promised its **San Jose lab and small-scale production facility** would be operational by May 2023. However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.
   * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023.""
7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.
   * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""

All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.

Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024.

1. **\*\*\*Misleading DoD contract:**
   * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.
      1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.
      2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract
2. **\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**
   * **Reality**: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report.
      1. **Ongoing Flight Testing**: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed **daily test flights** in preparation for their **FAA certification** and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested​.
      2. **Video Footage Authenticity**: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the **U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program**, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing.
3. **\*\*Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**
   * **Reality**: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments.
      1. **United Airlines** has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In **August 2023**, United was part of a **$215 million investment** round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a **$10 million pre-delivery payment** for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft​.
      2. **Stellantis**, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In **January 2023**, Stellantis committed **$150 million in equity** and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the **Midnight eVTOL**. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer.
      3. **Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024**, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million.
4. **\*\*\*\*\*FAA Certification Timeline:**
   * **Reality**: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification.
      1. **Significant FAA Milestones Achieved**: Archer has made substantial progress in its **FAA certification** pathway: **Final Airworthiness Criteria**: On **May 23, 2024**, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the **FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria** for the **Midnight** aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification​. **Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate** and **Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate**: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations
      2. **For-Credit Flight Testing**: As of **September 2024**, Archer successfully completed **402 test flights**. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for **for-credit flight testing**, which is expected to begin in **early 2024**​.
      3. **Delivery to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
      4. **Part 135 Certification**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.
5. **\*\*\*Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them.
      1. **Collaboration Instead of Defeat**: The settlement has evolved into a **collaboration agreement** between Archer and Wisk, with **Boeing** as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become **Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology**. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft.
      2. **Boeing Investment**: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a **significant investment** in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines**. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome.
6. **\*\*\*Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**
   * **Reality**: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.
      1. **San Jose Facility**: Archer completed the installation of its **high-volume battery pack manufacturing line** at the **San Jose Integrated Test Lab** in **May 2024**. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to **15,000 battery packs per year**, a crucial step toward scaling production​.
      2. **Conforming Midnight Aircraft**: Archer’s **first conforming Midnight aircraft** is expected to be completed in **Q4 2023**, with flight testing set to begin in **early 2024**. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress​.
      3. **Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility**: In addition, Archer began construction on a **high-volume manufacturing facility** in **Covington, Georgia** in **March 2023**. This facility, projected to support the production of up to **650 eVTOL aircraft per year**, is on track for completion in **2024**, ahead of the **Midnight** eVTOL’s planned entry into service in **2025**. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to **complete construction by the end of the year** as of July 2024.
7. **\*\*\*Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**
   * **Reality**: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis.
      1. **Stellantis Partnership**: Since **August 2023**, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing **$55 million** following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to **650 aircraft annually** once their **Covington, Georgia** facility is operational​. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.
      2. **Wisk/Boeing Settlement**: The **Boeing/Wisk** settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to **autonomy technology**, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a **$215 million** funding round, which included other major investors like **United Airlines** and **ARK Invest**. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs.

As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.

If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.

Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.

https://preview.redd.it/xdgt42wvnmrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e74db783587a8c3b4bf1d44326a0d5ced3c474

My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.

I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.

While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations.

This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.

Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.

**Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](https://verticalmag.com/news/faa-soon-to-release-final-sfar-for-powered-lift-aircraft):

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”

“I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \[industry\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”

The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.

Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.

However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.  
“There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \[the rule\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”

While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release.  
There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",121,0.86,181,1727563998.0,Part 2: Archer Aviation is a Table Pounding Buy as the Grizzly Research Report Caused Over ~27% Short - Dare I say I stand with Cathie Wood,"I did some digging because I felt [my previous DD on Archer Aviation]( wasn't to the standards I could be proud of and was rather light on information.

However, Grizzly’s investigation in July found the facility was far from complete, casting doubt on their production timelines.    * **Reference**: ""Our on-site visit in July found a very incomplete facility... not expected to be operational before October 2023."" 7. **Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**    * **Claim**: Archer diluted shareholders by issuing **free shares to partners** like United Airlines, often modifying or accelerating vesting schedules without clear disclosure, benefiting these partners at shareholders' expense.    * **Reference**: ""ACHR... discreetly amended and/or activated clauses to vest warrants early.""  All these claims, in my opinion, are a play against time. Time, eventually will either prove them right or prove them wrong. Time though is not the friend of this short report. With enough time business mode, transparency, and actual progress will come to light. It's easy to make these broad claims and try to tamp down expectations because this is a hard road ahead for a new form of aircraft and a new form of transportation. But this is no Hindenburg report because as you will see Adam Goldstein has been executing the hell out of his vision and should be applauded for it.  Let's take these claims 1 by 1 knowing what we now know as of today's date 9/28/2024.  1. **\*\*\*Misleading DoD contract:**    * **Reality**: the DoD and specifically the USAF have shown a commitment and desire for these new aircraft. The reality is a substantial commitment and desire from the military for mission critical operations planned for new eVTOL aircraft.       1. **Delivery of Midnight eVTOL to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft to the **U.S. Air Force** as part of its **$142 million contract** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**. This delivery shows substantial progress in Archer's partnership with the DoD, contradicting the earlier skepticism that the contract would yield minimal results.       2. **Use of Aircraft**: The U.S. Air Force plans to use the Midnight aircraft for **personnel transport, logistics, and rescue operations**, marking real military applications. The contract includes not just the aircraft but also **pilot training, maintenance, and certification support**, further validating the value of the contract 2. **\*Flight Activity Misrepresentation:**    * **Reality**: Archer is actually performing many flight tests and is even ahead of schedule for this activity. Grizzly actually went to the facility and took spy pictures of what seems to be parked aircraft in a hanger which proves, nothing about absolutely nothing. Funnily, they also asked in their asked neighboring businesses if they ""saw anything"" regarding test flights. LOL, I mean hmm so in other words you are asking them if they weren't doing their actual job and just watching the sky all day? Seems like a ridiculous anecdotal reference if you ask me. Also, the U.S. Military has taken part in the demonstrations so unless you are saying the U.S. Military is lying... Here are the facts since that report.       1. **Ongoing Flight Testing**: Archer continued to make significant strides in its testing program, including manned test flights of the **Midnight** eVTOL aircraft, which directly counter Grizzly's claims about limited flight activity. Archer has since confirmed **daily test flights** in preparation for their **FAA certification** and commercial launch, demonstrating more substantial progress than what the report suggested​.       2. **Video Footage Authenticity**: While Grizzly accused Archer of recycling video footage, post-August 2023, Archer showcased new videos of live flight tests, including those witnessed by government and military officials during demonstrations for the **U.S. Air Force's Agility Prime program**, further legitimizing their claims of frequent testing. 3. **\*\*Partnerships with Cheap Warrants:**    * **Reality**: Since the update of this report there have been significant updates that contradict Grizzly's thesis full of criticisms of Archer's partnerships with United Airlines and Stellantis. TLDR, everyone has literally doubled down their investment. These are not cheap words, warrants, or shallow commitments.       1. **United Airlines** has continued to show strong support for Archer, having made multiple investments since 2021. In **August 2023**, United was part of a **$215 million investment** round, its third time investing in Archer. United also made a **$10 million pre-delivery payment** for 100 of Archer's eVTOLs, demonstrating continued commitment to Archer’s future aircraft​.       2. **Stellantis**, Archer’s manufacturing partner, has similarly deepened its relationship. In **January 2023**, Stellantis committed **$150 million in equity** and began scaling up its role as Archer's exclusive manufacturing partner for the **Midnight eVTOL**. As of August 2023, Stellantis led the $215 million funding round, further solidifying its strategic alignment with Archer.       3. **Continued Insider Investment as of July 2024**, in the face of all of this just recently in July N.v. Stellantis in July bought 17 million shares for $54 million. 4. **\*\*\*\*\*FAA Certification Timeline:**    * **Reality**: This is both the most important and seemingly the biggest blunder of the short report. There is evidence that this may be the undoing of the short that I will discuss towards the end. In short, the notion that Archer was misleading investors is turning out to be a flat out misleading statement. To the contrary, in many ways they are ahead of schedule and or ontime. Especially, when you consider the difficulty of all of this. 2028 doesn't seem optimistic but rather an inevitability. So much so, they have scored 2 out of 3/4 of the FAA Type Certification which is outstanding. They are on total track for the FAA for-credit flight testing that will allow them to make test flights with an operational in-flight test pilot which is the critical part of their Type Certification.       1. **Significant FAA Milestones Achieved**: Archer has made substantial progress in its **FAA certification** pathway: **Final Airworthiness Criteria**: On **May 23, 2024**, Archer achieved a significant regulatory milestone when the **FAA issued the final airworthiness criteria** for the **Midnight** aircraft. This finalized the required steps for achieving Type Certification​. **Part 145 Maintenance & Repair Certificate** and **Part 135 Air Carrier Certificate**: Archer received both certifications from the FAA, which are essential for starting commercial operations       2. **For-Credit Flight Testing**: As of **September 2024**, Archer successfully completed **402 test flights**. These were completed ahead of schedule and have been crucial in preparing for **for-credit flight testing**, which is expected to begin in **early 2024**​.       3. **Delivery to the U.S. Air Force**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress.       4. **Part 135 Certification**: On **August 15, 2024**, Archer delivered its first **Midnight aircraft** to the **U.S. Air Force** under the **AFWERX Agility Prime program**, showcasing substantial military interest and further validating the company's technical progress. 5. **\*\*\*Misleading Settlement with Wisk/Boeing:**    * **Reality**: Grizzly makes the argument Archer's settlement with Wisk and Boeing was a costly defeat and a net negative. And they argue that reliance on Wisk's autonomous technology could jeopardize Archers future autonomy capabilities. In a master stroke Adam and the Archer team have turned this into a net positive for the prospects of the company. What's actually misleading is how Grizzly which writes the report on August 15th seemingly did a news grab from articles written just days prior making the case in the exact opposite sentiment than what Grizzly decided to report against. it's like you know the news is not that but you want to mislead for your own purposes so you decide to spin it in the opposite direction. This wasn't a legal defeat but rather an opportunity for Archer to form a lasting partnership with boeing and a sizeable investment from them.       1. **Collaboration Instead of Defeat**: The settlement has evolved into a **collaboration agreement** between Archer and Wisk, with **Boeing** as a key investor. Instead of a costly loss, the settlement paved the way for Wisk to become **Archer’s exclusive provider of autonomous flight technology**. This strategic partnership is expected to significantly enhance Archer's technological capabilities for future aircraft.       2. **Boeing Investment**: As part of the settlement, Boeing made a **significant investment** in Archer during a $215 million funding round that included major players like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines**. This is a substantial boost to Archer’s financial position, contradicting the narrative that the settlement was purely a negative outcome. 6. **\*\*\*Incomplete Manufacturing Facility:**    * **Reality**: Grizzly's early criticisms of Archer's manufacturing facilities is now crumbling with the reality their facilities' are nearing completion and are now operational. This is what I mean that the time of this report is not proving well for Grizzly. They are executing and point by point this report becomes more incorrect in its entire premis.       1. **San Jose Facility**: Archer completed the installation of its **high-volume battery pack manufacturing line** at the **San Jose Integrated Test Lab** in **May 2024**. This facility now has the capacity to produce up to **15,000 battery packs per year**, a crucial step toward scaling production​.       2. **Conforming Midnight Aircraft**: Archer’s **first conforming Midnight aircraft** is expected to be completed in **Q4 2023**, with flight testing set to begin in **early 2024**. The San Jose facility has been central to the assembly and testing of these aircraft, demonstrating substantial progress​.       3. **Covington, Georgia Manufacturing Facility**: In addition, Archer began construction on a **high-volume manufacturing facility** in **Covington, Georgia** in **March 2023**. This facility, projected to support the production of up to **650 eVTOL aircraft per year**, is on track for completion in **2024**, ahead of the **Midnight** eVTOL’s planned entry into service in **2025**. Per Archers news report, Archer’s team has made rapid progress with the buildout of this nearly 400,000 square foot facility and remains on track to **complete construction by the end of the year** as of July 2024. 7. **\*\*\*Stock Dilution and Early Vesting:**    * **Reality**: The fact is Adam is executing and institutions that were complaining or directly impacted are now converts into the Archer Aviation plan. The navigating here of issues and problems by Archer CEO Adam Goldstein is honestly a master-class if you ask me. At every turn of seemingly negative interactions Archer has leveraged partnerships over conflict and has secured long-term strategic advantages, mitigating concerns raised by Grizzly. This has been good for investors and antithetical to the shareholder dilution premis.       1. **Stellantis Partnership**: Since **August 2023**, Stellantis has increased its investment in Archer, contributing **$55 million** following successful flight milestones. Stellantis has remained a crucial manufacturing partner, providing capital, manufacturing expertise, and technical support. The partnership with Stellantis is expected to help Archer scale up production to **650 aircraft annually** once their **Covington, Georgia** facility is operational​. This long-term commitment demonstrates that the warrants issued to Stellantis have fostered a valuable strategic alliance rather than merely diluting shareholders.       2. **Wisk/Boeing Settlement**: The **Boeing/Wisk** settlement resulted in Archer gaining access to **autonomy technology**, which is crucial for scaling the eVTOL business in the future. Boeing has invested in Archer as part of a **$215 million** funding round, which included other major investors like **United Airlines** and **ARK Invest**. These investments further strengthen Archer’s financial position and allow it to avoid significant R&D costs.  As you see, none of the key points made by Grizzly are coming to fruition, and in many cases, Archer has used the challenges to strengthen their strategy and vision.  If you remember in the conversation I alluded to that there is some evidence that the short which was almost at 30% has come down from that level to the 22.28% as last reported.  Here are the short stats from Benzinga with highs in the short as recent as the month of August.    My theory is these shorts are going to start to exit as Archer continues to execute.  I am looking at a strategy of staggered calls in the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month range. At some point Archer is going to get it's 3rd and most important leg of the FAA Type certification which is the for-credit flight testing that essentially is the green light for piloted flights. After that it will be smooth sailing with only manufacturing (production certification) left to certify.  While the Grizzly Research short report was seemingly more apt over a year ago, it absolutely is proving to be inaccurate and obsolete on all of their main points and concerns criticizing the notion of viability for Archer Aviation's Air-Mobility aspirations.  This is one where I think Cathie has done her due diligence and is correct in her outlook and investment into AA along with United Airlines and Stellantis. The DoD contracts are coming in and the USAF can't wait to get their hands on these aircraft. Cathie and ARK are doubling down again and this time it's the shorts that maybe on the wrong side of history as certification seems inevitable for flight and operations of Archer Aviations Midnight eVTOL aircraft.  With the stock nearing ATLows this stock looks to pop at some point with any positive news on the certification front. The sweet spot here looks to be 6 and 9 month calls along with straight up shares.  Currently I have a small position and calls in the October 18th and November 15th timeframe. When I figure out the exact call I want I am going big. I will update you on that front when i have more information.  **Update**: [Analyst have this a Moderate Buy and a lot of Overweight ratings from top investment firms](  A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Benchmark reaffirmed a ""buy"" rating and issued a $12.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Friday, August 9th. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an ""overweight"" rating and issued a $10.00 price objective on shares of Archer Aviation in a research note on Monday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their price objective on shares of Archer Aviation from $5.00 to $6.00 and gave the stock an ""overweight"" rating in a research report on Wednesday, July 24th. Finally, HC Wainwright started coverage on shares of Archer Aviation in a report on Tuesday, September 3rd. They issued a ""buy"" rating and a $12.50 target price on the stock. One investment analyst has rated the stock with a hold rating and four have assigned a buy rating to the stock. According to data from [MarketBeat.com]( Archer Aviation has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy"" and a consensus target price of $9.00.  **Update 2**: [This information is huge regarding final SFAR FAA Rule](  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to release a crucial regulation that will help pave the way for the commercialization of eVTOL aircraft in the U.S., according to Christopher Coes, acting under secretary of transportation for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.  Speaking at Honeywell’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Summit on Sept. 19, Coes announced that the final special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) for powered-lift pilot certification and operations is expected to be published in the “next month.”  “I think you’ll see it is quite responsive to \[industry\] comments,” Coes told attendees. “It will come well ahead of certifications that the FAA is working very hard with our manufacturers.”  The SFAR was a hot topic at last year’s summit, where the draft version faced considerable criticism. Industry concerns focused on the certification process for pilots, the requirement for dual flight controls, energy reserves for electric aircraft, and flight simulation training devices.  Many in the industry felt the rules governing pilot certification and operations of a novel technology like powered-lift eVTOLs should be modernized to reflect the unique aspects of electrification and range.  However, at this year’s summit, the mood had shifted toward cautious optimism for the release of the final SFAR.   “There’s great anticipation for the rule, which we’re told is coming in just a few weeks,” said Kristie Greco Johnson, senior vice president of government affairs with the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). “If the FAA can deliver \[the rule\] in just a few short weeks, it’ll be a major accomplishment for the agency.”  While Coes contends the final SFAR will be released in the next month, the FAA technically has until Dec. 16 to finalize the regulation, according to the FAA reauthorizaton bill. The same bill also mandated that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) be issued by Sept. 16. However, the FAA missed that deadline, raising concerns about the SFAR’s timely release.   There is broad consensus that the U.S. faces stiff competition from global players to lead in AAM. With first movers like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation aiming for a 2025 commercialization of eVTOLs, the pressure is on the FAA to meet expectations.",0.0,0.08400775741201276
wallstreetbets,How To Play the Alien Invasion of October,"Hey guys. I know it’s a heavy topic we have to deal with today, and I know it’s Saturday which is when everyone is off doing their most important work of the week, but I couldn’t leave my fellow well-regarded degenerates out in the cold.

The top analysts at the world’s foremost center for NHI analysis and behavioral study, r/aliens, predict that at the end of this month, a 70-year-old contract between the US and the dominant species of NHI visiting Earth will expire. Given the extreme importance of such a global event and its wide-ranging implications for the future of humanity as a species, I feel it’s important that we all come together and attempt to hammer out the best strategy for how to play this on the stock market now, before the proverbial feces hits Cramer’s wildly panning cameras. 

Here’s the sauce (one of many), for anyone who still believes anything as mundane as ‘details’ still matter in this late hour of humanity’s brief history:
https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/s/5n8JJNN2CX

To get the ball rolling, I have a few ideas:

Firstly, I would go long on WMT. Remember when COVID hit and everybody started eating toilet paper? Yeah, double that. Paper towels too. Very bullish on WMT during invasion. 

Secondly, I would short insurance—UNLESS it comes out that every CEO of every insurance company on Earth is already an alien. Which, actually, we already know they are. So go long insurance, because that’s the winning team. I have always loved insurance and I just want to take a moment to say publicly that I did not teach my children that most of it is a scam. 

Thirfthly, strongly consider a full port into UVXY, because the VIX is going to Hulk dick as high and as hard as….. uh, as Hulk’s dick. (I can’t afford a ghost writer.) Unless alien invasion is already priced in, which is likely at this time of year. Your call. 

Interested to see other thoughts and potential plays. It also occurred to me to start going to superstores and asking for all their discarded boxes, just in case cardboard is gold to the aliens. Seems like a good hedge.

FACEDRIVE (FD.V)-> ARGO Corporation (ARGH.V),"I don't know if you guys know this company called ARGO Corporation (ARGH.V), this company was previously called FACEDRIVE (FD.V). It was ride sharing company that pretty much got so much fkn funding from the Canadian government and went from couple cents to $60 fkn dollars during covid. Apparently, it was a pump and dump. People made so much money but those that got bag held at the top filed a lawsuit and the CEO (Sayan Navaratnam) stepped down from CEO and he can't start another company for 3 or 4 years.

Anyway, this is where it gets interesting. Now, this company, about last year, changed its name to Argo Corporation (ARGH.V). Essentially now they ""provide public transportation and mobility technology solutions in Canada"". They are looking to make autonomy busses that will power the whole transportation system in all provinces.

The co-founders of this new company is Praveen Arichandran who was **head of growth at Tesla,** Qamar Qureshi **president of Kowledgehook**, Sisun Lee previous **product manager at Facebook**, and Holly Lim **CFO of Google's Sidewalk Labs**. The team here is fkn crazy, I mean wtf, like top guys coming to Canada from Silicon Valley to make a transportation company in Ontario which is heavily operated by Metrolinx (funded by the Government of Ontario) and in the near future they are looking to make all transportation electric and autonomous.

Is this just another pump and dump, I mean since late last year the stock did some crazy numbers, but I don't know what to make out of this. Just another pump and dump or an actual company that’s looking to forget the past and actually do something for the future?

# [Why a Qualcomm takeover of Intel is hard to make work](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-qualcomm-takeover-intel-hard-141757123.html)

Intel stock climbs as Apollo Global Management ([APO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/APO?.tsrc=fin-srch)), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, [reportedly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-22/apollo-is-said-to-offer-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-intel) offered a multibillion-dollar investment. That came after [reports ](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d)that Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM)) approached Intel with a buyout offer. Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst, joins Morning Brief hosts [Brad Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/) and [Seana Smith](https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/) to discuss the legacy chipmaker’s position amid reported takeover and investment opportunities.

Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance he has “a hard time seeing that deal work, especially if the fabs are included, and the issue is that they're losing a lot of money right now.” A fab is a semiconductor fabrication facility, a factory that makes chips.

“Qualcomm would probably have to use a lot of stock. If they did a stock deal, it's significantly dilutive for Qualcomm. It could be 20% or even more dilutive, and the problem is if they start borrowing money and adding cash, the leverage goes up really, really high, really, really quickly.”

The analyst says, “I have a really hard time seeing it work with the fabs. I'm not sure that they could do a deal without the fabs,” as, in his view, they couldn’t spin off their fab businesses into independent companies, but they can’t scrap them. “I don't think that that's politically viable at this point,” as the US prioritizes its position in the global chip market.

He adds, “I'd rather not see Qualcomm do a deal like this. I think it's hard to do a deal where I think the risk would justify the returns on this. We'll see if they can construct something. But I don't really like it. So I'm hoping we don't have something like this.”

Regarding the potential Apollo investment, Rasgon highlights that Apollo has an [existing relationship](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-apollo-agree-joint-venture-200500820.html) with Intel. The analyst says that while neither party has confirmed the reports that Apollo could invest up to $5 billion in Intel, the story could be viewed as “a vote of confidence” in the company.

Rasgon says the regulatory side of a potential Qualcomm takeover is “really tough,” though he notes in the US it “could be easier” as its “a US national champion buying a national champion.”

He says, “There are very few areas where Qualcomm and Intel really overlap,” with the auto space being one. He explains that Intel and Qualcomm have likely discussed Intel divesting from Mobileye ([MBLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MBLY)) if there is a takeover.

wallstreetbets,RKLB - a DD for Simple Jacks,"RKLB is complicated. It’s a rocket and rocket systems end to end company.

I’ve seen many confuse it with RKT- a mortgage company, that is how regarded people are.

If you read my DD on HIMS it was much more complicated.  If you traded on that, congrats you are up 18% in less than a month.

I’ve done similar research on RKLB and taken a $12k position in calls expiring January.

Here’s the quick DD:

They make rockets, and successfully launch satellites into orbit for small and medium size satellites.

Spacex has a sort of monopoly on launching the larger satellites with larger rocket, Falcon 9.

RKLB, is making a rocket to compete with falcon 9 and will be done in a year or so.

Spacex has a $200B or so evaluation.

RKLB has a $4B evaluation.

200/4=50 

50x gain opportunity.  And that’s just shares.

With options napkin math you can 5-10x ur gains if you pick the right contracts.

So there’s a 250x return here just waiting to be taken.

Risks people keep saying that aren’t true:  “they will go bankrupt their cash burn is crazy!”  

They are actually profitable if you don’t include what they are spending for the next year or 1.5 years to finish their falcon 9 competitor rocket, which is the whole point of the thesis.

They have executed flawlessly on building many rockets so far that are putting satellites into space.

There is a more complicated platform play here for the true artists.

But personally I like to keep it simple:

250-500x return on long calls, 50x return on shares.

Buy buy buy 

Except this isn’t financial advice,
It’s a fucking rocket company

U can lose all ur money but imo gamble is

I am myself a Chinese citizen, came to the US and studied for 7 years. Now I've worked for 1.5 yrs, just paid off some money I borrowed from my family. Being debt free, I looked into investing 3 months ago, started by doing day trading on a paper account for a few weeks, kind of understood generally how short term trades work, and it certainly helped me in doing 1dte and 0dte SPY options later on.

However, with my minimal initial capital, investing in stocks have very diminishing returns. I then thought options is literately perfect. If I loss everything, it doesn't matter, I am young and don't really have much in hand anyway. But if I win big, I can have a meaningful starting capital to do some more stable investing with more meaningful returns. I put a month's paycheck minus rent into options gambling and started the journey right as the July huge dip happened.

For the next two months, it was really meh, sometimes I win, but there were a few times when I was down 80% and bounced back. My downfall is holding on to gains for too long... and they just fizzle out later (its almost like if I browse WSB daily XD).

Around last week, my mom also gave me a speculative 1.5k for investing in the US, since China has been in a multi-year shit market. She told me exactly which stocks to buy, but gave me free control over 200$ of it in options play.

Finally the day came. Wednesday I turned 200$ into 600$ on PDD calls during trading hours, sold the gains and bought 1.2k worth of OTM PDD, BABA, and JD calls expiring on Friday right before close. Overnight I watched the Hang Seng index, the SSE index, and JD/BABA charts on HSE, and I almost shitted myself... JD rose 10% overnight, and PDD gained 12 dollars. I immediately closed all these positions in the morning.

Now, my initial investment has almost 5x'ed, and my mom's money also 2.5x'ed. I can finally do fun things like the wheel strategy, and investing in stocks will now have meaningful returns. I put almost all my investment money + a bit more deposits into stocks, and left out 500$ to keep gambling in options. I told my mom to do the same with her money, and I will keep doing options with 300$ of it. If somehow I can 10x this, I will pull out the majority into stocks, and repeat with 1000$ for options play. Currently I have already 2x'ed that 500$.

Now my positions...

I still think the Chinese economy is being driven by the ccp into a dumpster, and the stimulus, at least in the near future, won't fix it at all. However, I will continue to ride this wave of Chinese market rally for some time. I think there's gonna be around another week's worth of gains on the table. Though now I have no Chinese options held over the weekend, most of my money are in various Chinese stocks, and they most likely will go into SPXL, MOAT, gold and some selected US stocks after this wave of rally fades.

Hopefully next week Chinese stocks make me proud and 10x my options play money again.",44,0.67,50,1727496868.0,China Gains!,"1.2k turned into 13k, thank you PDD BABA and JD    I am myself a Chinese citizen, came to the US and studied for 7 years.

&#x200B;

*Key Points*

* *Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*
* *“We are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics.*
* *Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*

&#x200B;

*Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*  
  
*Instead, the central bank chief asserted during a speech in Nashville, he and his colleagues will seek to balance bringing down inflation with supporting the labor market and let the data guide future moves.*  
  
*“Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.”*  
  
*The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction in the Fed’s key overnight borrowing rate.*  
  
*Though markets had been largely expecting the move, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008.*  
  
*Addressing the decision, Powell said it reflected policymakers’ belief that it was time for a “recalibration” of policy that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as “solid” though it has “clearly cooled over the last year.”*  
  
*“That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective,” Powell said.*  
  
*“We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation,” added Powell, who gave no outward indication of where he sees the next move going.*  
  
*Powell’s assertion that the Fed has not predetermined policy is in keeping with past statements.*  
  
*Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut.*  
  
*For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*  
  
*Inflation during August was around 2.2% annually, according to the Fed’s preferred consumer price expenditures prices index released Friday. While that is close to the central bank’s 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items.*  
  
*Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals.*  
  
*“Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly,” he said. “The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*  
  
*Following the speech, Powell was scheduled to sit for a question-and-answer session with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.*",55,0.97,18,1727719261.0,"Powell indicates further rate cuts, but insists the Fed is ‘not on any preset course’","**Powell indicates further rate cuts, but insists the Fed is ‘not on any preset course’**  [  &x200B;  *Key Points*  * *Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.* * *“We are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics.* * *Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*  &x200B;  *Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*      *Instead, the central bank chief asserted during a speech in Nashville, he and his colleagues will seek to balance bringing down inflation with supporting the labor market and let the data guide future moves.*      *“Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance.

The outlook portion that is bringing down CCL stock:

> Carnival anticipates net yields growing by approximately 5.0% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and by about 10.4% for the full year. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for 5.76% and 10.52%, respectively. Net yield measures revenue per available passenger cruise day, after deducting expenses like airfare, commissions, and other direct costs.

Some other info on the earnings [from street insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Earnings/Carnival+Corp.+%28CCL%29+Tops+Q3+EPS+by+10c/23778490.html):

Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) reported Q3 EPS of $1.27, $0.10 better than the analyst estimate of $1.17. Revenue for the quarter came in at $7.89 billion versus the consensus estimate of $7.82 billion.

2024 Outlook

For the full year 2024, the company expects:

* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 10.4 percent compared to 2023, better than June guidance, based on continued strength in demand.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 3.5 percent compared to 2023, approximately 1 percentage point better than June guidance driven by cost saving opportunities, accelerated easing of inflationary pressures and benefits from one-time items.
* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $6.0 billion, up over 40 percent compared to 2023 and better than June guidance by nearly $200 million.
* Adjusted return on invested capital (""ROIC"") of approximately 10.5 percent, an improvement of approximately 5.0 percentage points compared to 2023 and half a point better than June guidance.
* For the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects:
* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 5.0 percent compared to particularly strong 2023 levels.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 8.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher dry-dock days and higher investment in advertising.

stocks,Eyeing Simply Good Foods (SMPL) for a LT Investment,"I'm considering an investment in Simply Good Foods (SMPL) as part of a 20-year strategy in the consumer goods space. Why? Because I believe consumer goods companies that align with health trends can grow even in downturns. I’m aiming for a long-term hold, looking for strong growth, stable value, and low debt.

**Why Simply Good Foods?** The company owns three key brands: Atkins, Quest, and OWYN. While Atkins and OWYN have their challenges, Quest is a leader in the protein bar market. If a store sells protein bars, they probably stock Quest. It's a solid brand with mass distribution and great market share among fitness and health-conscious consumers.

**Recent Financial Performance**: The company has been growing steadily. Fiscal 2023 saw $955.6 million in net sales, driven mainly by Quest, with 14.2% growth in sales. Plus, they operate an asset-light model, which means they outsource manufacturing – keeping costs low and free cash flow high. Cash reserves increased to $208.7 million, and debt was reduced to $237.7 million – signs of solid financial health.

**Growth Catalysts**:

* Acquisition of OWYN: Simply Good Foods bought OWYN, a plant-based protein brand, for $280 million. This taps into the rising trend of plant-based diets and brings a whole new consumer base.
* E-commerce Opportunities: They’re expanding their e-commerce channels – currently, 21% of Quest and 14% of Atkins sales are online – so there's definitely room for growth here.

**Competition & Risks**: Simply Good Foods does face competition in both bars and drinks. But Quest’s distribution advantage gives it a strong moat, and with Atkins and OWYN being rebranded, there’s potential for growth. Still, they’ll need to walk a fine line to keep market share against competitors like FitCrunch, Pure Protein, and bigger players like Fairlife (Coke).

**Final Thoughts**: SMPL feels like an interesting long-term play, aligning with health and nutrition trends while being reasonably valued and not over-leveraged. But it’s not without challenges – especially in marketing, e-commerce, and competition in the drink and bar markets.

If you’re invested or have thoughts on Simply Good Foods, I'd love to hear! And if you've tried any of their products – Atkins, Quest, or OWYN – let me know what you think.

But Quest’s distribution advantage gives it a strong moat, and with Atkins and OWYN being rebranded, there’s potential for growth. Still, they’ll need to walk a fine line to keep market share against competitors like FitCrunch, Pure Protein, and bigger players like Fairlife (Coke).  **Final Thoughts**: SMPL feels like an interesting long-term play, aligning with health and nutrition trends while being reasonably valued and not over-leveraged. But it’s not without challenges – especially in marketing, e-commerce, and competition in the drink and bar markets.  If you’re invested or have thoughts on Simply Good Foods, I'd love to hear! And if you've tried any of their products – Atkins, Quest, or OWYN – let me know what you think. Consumer feedback is key in understanding how strong a brand really is.",0.7,0.21541182501708822

stocks,"AI Plays: NVD, AMD, GOOGL + a Couple Broader Questions","What’s up people,

Hope everyone is good. Posting this in hopes of getting some discussion about AI and possible investments going.

For context, with all the talk about AI going on, I've been trying to learn what I can about it. I don’t have any relevant background or expertise, but I’ve increasingly felt compelled to learn about it so I'm at least not totally ignorant. At this point, I’ve mostly been watching YouTube interviews of Altman/Zuckerberg/Gates types, along with lectures that Stanford makes available.

In the midst of this, I watched two videos in which separate AI researchers mentioned a [2019 blog post titled “The Bitter Lesson.”](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Apparently, this blog post was written by a computer scientist and is really influential in the field. One of the main takeaways, as I understand it, is that all that really matters for improving AI is providing more computing power.

Given how much the tech community seems to believe this, I decided to make a few plays in the space, buying literally just a few shares of NVDA, AMD, and GOOGL earlier this week. NVDA and GOOGL are obviously some of the biggest names in the space, albeit in different aspects. I took a chance on AMD, even though people seem to say their tech isn't as good, just because I still feel like it could rise with the rest of the field as long as people keep thinking AI is the future.

To be candid, I’m cynical about about how AI will be used and, more broadly, I don’t really think this is a great time to just now be getting into the market- from my perspective, it still seems like a lot of people are burnt out from work/life, and the companies that are making more money seem to be doing so largely by raising prices. I’m not sure how sustainable it all is without some sort of correction. Still, I wanted to get a little skin in the game so that I’m motivated to keep learning.

If anyone finds any of this worth talking about, I have two ongoing questions at this point:

1)    What really excites people in the field about generative AI/large language models from a technological/computer science perspective? For example, when blockchain was blowing up, I heard it said that Blockchain was exciting because it made it possible to transfer a digital file such that the original sender no longer possessed the file after sending. Regardless of my personal opinions on the technology, that explanation at least made sense to me, and I could imagine possible applications and why people might be excited. What is it about AI that likewise has tech experts so excited really? What specifically does it allow them to do that they could never do before, and why is that valuable?

2)    Outside of the people running tech companies, who is really positioned to benefit from AI? In nearly every video I see of Sam Altman talking, he says something like, “I believe AI will have a positive net benefit on society overall.” I wonder, though, how he would measure this. It seems to me like AI will help any company or user that can leverage it to make money, but could end up harming a lot of employees and end consumers. I feel like it could just accelerate trends of companies extracting more and more money from the rest of the population. I'm really not trying to make this political or turn it into a debate on capitalism. That’s just my honest gut feeling about it from an economic perspective at this point. I see it providing a lot of benefit to a relatively small segment of the population.

Would be interested to hear what other people think and if/how you are investing in the space. I'd even like to know if people here actually use AI in their personal lives. And if anyone has resources that they feel have helped deepen their knowledge about AI, I’d really appreciate you sharing. I feel like I’ve kind of hit a wall trying to get beyond surface-level discussions about the field.

stocks,Simulating an international ETF for my portfolio based on market cap. Would this be a nightmare?,"Hello, I am a Canadian investor who has most of my money in S&P 500 Etfs, Nasdaq ETFs, other various ETFs, Berkshire Hathaways, and a small amount of stocks. Not very diversified outside of America. I buy these on the TSX mostly in Canadian funds, but I also have some in American dollars bought form the NYSE.

I have a desire to diversify outside of America but have always been disappointed in the gains of international ETFs compared to US based ones. I have also been reading recently about how large market cap companies generally grow better than small ones. It does kind of make sense in a world of increasing hyper capitalism, where big money can grow better, innovate better, and buy up competition. Taking these factors in to account, I am going to explore simulating an ETF of large cap international stocks.

My method is going to be to take a set of the biggest market cap international companies and buy some. Their size of the pie will be based on percentage of market cap.

https://www.tradingview.com/markets/world-stocks/worlds-non-us-companies/

To do a simple example, if I only wanted to do the 5 top companies in the world outside of US, it would be Saudi Aramco at 1.777 trillion market cap, Taiwan Semiconductor at 820 billion, Novo Nordisk at 528, Tencent at 521, and Louis Vuitton at 392. Their total market cap is 4.038 trillion. As far as percentages of that total, Saudi Aramco is 44.0%, Taiwan Semiconductor is 20.3%, Novo Nordisk is 13.1%, Tencent is 12.9%, and Louie Vuitton is 9.7%.

Say you have 10k to invest, you would buy $4400 of Saudi Aramco, $2030 of Taiwan Semiconductors, $1310 of Novo Nordisk, $1290 of Tencent $1290, and $970 of Louie Vuitton. Let's say we re-balance these every quarter, so as some companies strengthen, we buy more, and as they weaken we sell, and if a company drops off the top 5, we ditch it and get the new arrival. And if the list of companies is 20 or more deep, it should be some nice diversification of countries and industries, but with one thing in common, they are all ultra successful companies. 

Do people have opinions on this strategy? It's basically running a personal one-man-show international ETF (I tried looking for a product that would do this for me but none satisfied my desire of just the top of the top international companies). How difficult would this be to do and what would be potential tax ramifications? I believe as a Canadian I would use Interactive brokers for the multiple currencies, and buying fractional shares which I believe I can do on there, but I've never used it. Also can I access all stock markets these companies would be available on via Interactive brokers? I could potential do this in my Tax Free Savings Account to not have to deal with taxes, but if I did it in my taxable account what would the ramifications be? Also any advice on the ramifications or how to deal with the dividends? 

Any thoughts or tips on this strategy would be greatly appreciated, also is there a way to backtest this strategy, perhaps I could simplify to re-balance once a year. Thanks in advance for any advice.

And if some big investment company wants to take this idea and make a top 20 ex-US ETF or a top 50 ex-US ETF via market cap, go right ahead and I'll be the first to buy. And maybe give me a little kickback if it's popular ;)

EDIT: Looks like one issure is many of these companies are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which I can't buy as a Canadian.

stocks,Title: Potential Investment in Breathe BioMedical Inc. ($BRTH) - Thoughts on Their Upcoming IPO?,"Hello everyone,

I’m considering investing in Breathe BioMedical Inc. ($BRTH) as they’re planning to go public soon. I found some information in the IPO Investing Center in the SoFi app, and I’m currently trying to evaluate if this would be a worthwhile investment. From what I’ve gathered, Breathe BioMedical is focused on developing diagnostic tools for early disease detection, which sounds promising given the growing healthcare and biotechnology trends. However, I’d really appreciate your input on this opportunity.

Some specific things I’m considering:

	1.	Company Overview & Market Position: Does anyone have deeper insight into Breathe BioMedical’s competitive edge? How does their technology stack up against other diagnostic companies, especially in early detection?
	2.	Product & Market Demand: How viable is their product? From what I understand, they’re in the field of non-invasive diagnostics—how strong is the demand for such technology in the current and projected future market? Are they addressing a significant unmet need?
	3.	Financial Health & IPO Valuation: I haven’t been able to find a lot of financial details, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on their valuation and whether their financials suggest they have the runway needed for sustainable growth. Have any of you seen their financial metrics, and do they seem justifiable for an IPO?
	4.	Regulatory & Clinical Considerations: Given the nature of their business, they’ll need regulatory approvals for their technology. Does anyone know the current status of these approvals or any clinical trials? How risky is this aspect of the investment?
	5.	Management Team & Experience: I’m also curious about the management team’s track record. Do they have the experience necessary to navigate the complexities of the biotech and diagnostic space? Have they led successful ventures in the past?
	6.	Broader Market Conditions: Considering the recent trends in biotech and healthcare IPOs, do you think this sector is currently favorable for a new player like Breathe BioMedical? How do current market conditions influence your perspective on investing in a company like this?

Overall, I see a lot of potential in early disease detection technologies, especially non-invasive ones, but I also recognize the challenges of investing in a company at such an early stage. Would love to hear your opinions, insights, or any research you may have done on $BRTH. Do you think this could be a good long-term investment, or are there major red flags I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

Have they led successful ventures in the past? 	6.	Broader Market Conditions: Considering the recent trends in biotech and healthcare IPOs, do you think this sector is currently favorable for a new player like Breathe BioMedical? How do current market conditions influence your perspective on investing in a company like this?  Overall, I see a lot of potential in early disease detection technologies, especially non-invasive ones, but I also recognize the challenges of investing in a company at such an early stage. Would love to hear your opinions, insights, or any research you may have done on $BRTH. Do you think this could be a good long-term investment, or are there major red flags I should be aware of?

stocks,Deep dive into Manchester United ($MANU) - Rich Men's Ego Boost,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2012, Manchester United became a public company, at $14/share. 

Over a decade later with many ups and downs, the share price is **up disappointing 18%**. For comparison, the S&P500 is up **over 300%** during the same period, and the FTSE100 is up a bit **over 40%**.

The club’s financials continue to deteriorate, and I’m sure anyone who supports a sports club has plenty of ideas about what can be done differently.

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why the club is deteriorating (financially) and how I concluded that **sports clubs are billionaires’ toys that serve to boost their egos.**

  
**2.0 How does Manchester United (or any other sports club) make money?**

Sports clubs generally have 3 key revenue sources and here’s what the development of each one looked like for Manchester United over the last decade:

**Commercial**: £303m (vs. £189, a decade ago) - Growth of 4.8% per year

**Broadcasting**: £222m (vs. £136m a decade ago) - Growth of 5% per year

**Matchday**: £137m (vs. £108m a decade ago) - Growth of 2.4% per year



Let’s have a look at each one separately, and in each segment, try to answer the following question: ***How much is this revenue source depending on the fans?***

**2.1 Commercial revenue** consists of:

1. **Sponsorship deals** with various global and regional partners - Such as TeamViewer, the main sponsor on their shirts, but also the ones shown on the advertisement boards around the field.
2. **Merchandising, product licensing, and retail** - Club-branded merchandise, including shirts, training kits, and other apparel. It also covers licensing agreements that allow third parties to produce and sell Manchester United-branded products.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Absolutely! The link to the merchandising and product licensing/retail segment is quite clear, but the sponsorship deals are also valued based on the exposure given to the companies. The more fans a club has, the more a company is willing to pay for its promotion.



**2.2 Broadcasting revenue** has a comparable growth, averaging **5% per year**. Apart from the revenue share of the matches (Premier League, Champions League, and other competitions), this includes MANU TV, a monthly subscription that generates over £6m per year.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Not always, as a significant portion of it is split equally, regardless of the club and the number of fans. However, it is dependent on the success of the club and its participation in major competitions.



**2.3** **Matchday revenue** doesn’t need any introduction, although it had surprisingly low growth of \~2% per year, which is lower than the inflation rate.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** - Absolutely!



*Conclusion: All of the 3 revenue sources have very low growth, and are dependent on the two key points:*

* *The competitions the club participates in, and its success in them, and*
* *The number of fans (attending the matches, paying for MUTV, buying apparel, etc.)*

**It is safe to say that over 70% of all the revenue is derived directly from the fans.**

  
**3.0 Key expenses**

Now, let’s have a look at the key expenses and their development over time:

**Employee benefit expenses**: £365m (vs. £215, a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

**Amortization**: £190m (vs. £55m a decade ago) - Growth of 11.2% per year

**Other operating expenses**: £149m (vs. £88m a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

  
What you will notice is that **all of them have been growing at a faster pace than the revenue.** The key drivers behind this are the **larger transfer fees** and **higher salaries**. It is worth noting that the recent involvement of the Saudi clubs put even more pressure. Here's some more information about each category, for those who are interested:

**Employee benefit expenses -** The compensation of the players, managers, staff, administration, etc.

**Amortization -** Anytime a player is bought from another club, the costs associated with the acquisition of the player are capitalized, and then amortized over the duration of the contract period. For example, if a player had a £30m transfer fee, and the contract length is 3 years, there will be a £10m amortization expense per year recognized in the income statement.

**Other operating expenses -** All the other expenses, ranging from security stewarding and cleaning at Old Trafford to property costs, maintenance, HR, professional fees, etc.

  
**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

So, if we add all of this together, the outcome is low revenue growth, with significant declining profitability. The operating margin is down from **positive 15%** to **negative 10%.** This is, after all, a very competitive environment, where no single team has been at the very top for decades in all competitions. It requires significant investments (especially in players and top management), and even then, success is not guaranteed and is temporary.

*So, you might ask:* **What is the value of a company that is not profitable, operates in a competitive field, and even success is temporary? The answer will likely be $0.**



**5.0 There is no value?**

So, is there no value? Is one of the biggest clubs in the world worthless?

I’d argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, aren’t valued, as there’s no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being **priced**. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and they’re likely going through a checklist.

Did I buy 5 more houses? Great, check.

How about a yacht and a private jet? Yep, got it.

Damn, there’s still a lot of money left, what should I do? Oh, wait, what about a sports club?

**The owners of a sports club (in this case, the Glazer family will make money only when they sell the club to someone who is willing to pay more than they initially paid.**

  
**6.0 The emotional side**

There’s another angle that we need to explore, which is the emotional side. Some fans proudly own shares of the club, where the goal is not so much to make more money but to be a proud minority owner of the club. As such, there is nothing wrong with that.

However, there have been many examples when the stock price went up/down for ridiculous reasons. For example, there was a share price increase in 2013, due to the announcement that the club signed Fellaini. On the other side, the share price dropped \~9% on the speculation that the club might sign Ezequiel Garay. I’ll leave it up to you to decide how impactful these events are on the club’s value.

Fans will always criticize the owners/managers for the poor performance, and to a large extent, rightfully so. However, when it comes to the financial side and the share price, Manchester United is not an exception.

Take a look at the share price of Juventus, and try to guess what the spike in 2018 relates to.

If you guessed ***Cristiano Ronaldo***, well done! Don’t get me wrong. Events like this have some (minor) impact on the success of the club during a short period of time. In the case of Ronaldo, it might even bring better sponsorship deals, higher ticket prices, and more apparel sales. However, it also comes with an additional cost (his salary!). **In the long run, none of these individual events have a significant impact on the value of a football club.**

Two other football clubs that are public are Borussia Dortmund and Sporting. You can have a look at their share prices too.

**7.0 The transfer period**

Although fans are generally emotional and excited about the club they support, the transfer period is just different. There is a lot of speculation to follow, building up the expectations for the year to come.

Well, here’s how the share price changed during the transfer period (From June 10th to September 1st), in each year since the company was public.



|Year|Manchester United|S&P500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2013|-1%|-1%|
|2014|-3%|3%|
|2015|7%|-6%|
|2016|-1%|4%|
|2017|-1%|2%|
|2018|22%|4%|
|2019|-4%|1%|
|2020|-10%|12%|
|2021|11%|7%|
|2022|11%|1%|
|2023|22%|5%|
|2024|3%|3%|
|**Total compounded return**|**64%**|**40%**|

As you can see, investing in Manchester United during the transfer period was a better decision than investing in the S&P500 during the same period. In fact, this return has been crushing the return of the stock since its IPO (which, as mentioned at the very beginning, is around a disappointing \~20%).

  
So, is this a terrible company to invest in? **Fundamentally, yes.**

Anyone who invests in Manchester United, bets that there will be a **transfer of ownership**, which will push the share price up. There were rumors for that back in February of 2023 when the share price went up almost double. Should those rumors come back, I do expect a movement of at least 60% from today’s share price.

stocks,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.

With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.    **What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.    With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.    Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.    While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.    Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com]( which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**     Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:  * Waymo: 17,311 miles * **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles * [Pony.Ai]( (startup): 17,077 miles * WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles  The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**     **Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology.

>Negotiations between the union representing dockworkers and a shipping industry group representing terminal operators and ocean carriers have been stalled for months, with both sides this week issuing conflicting statements about their willingness to bargain.

>The union representing 45,000 dockworkers, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), is threatening to strike at ports from Massachusetts to Texas if a new labor deal with the USMX isn't reached before the current contract expires at midnight on September 30. A walkout would be the first East Coast dock strike since 1977. 

>The ports that could close in a strike handle more than 68% of all containerized exports in the U.S. and roughly 56% of containerized imports, according to industry data. So even a short strike would cause significant disruptions in regional trade flows. One analysis estimated that could cost the U.S. economy as much $5 billion a day.

stocks,The Chinese stock market is notching its strongest weekly gain since 2014.,"The CSI300 is up by 12.4% this week so far, which is its strongest weekly gain since December 2014 (+13.4%). By the end of the day, it could be strongest weekly gain since 2008. I know we hate investing in China in this sub, but there might be a point for adding a bit of China back into your portfolio today. There are two main investment theses:

1. The Chinese consumer is not financially weak, they are simply sentiment driven.
2. Chinese government support for the market is sending the signal for retail investors to invest.

**Point 1:** Context for today's environment. Chinese stock market pessimism reached peak in February 2024 as it appeared the government was not keen to provide policy support. This was a mistake in messaging by the CCP. Chinese investing culture is extremely different from the US. While US markets are more sophisticated and fundamental driven - Chinese investors are HIGHLY sentimental. Western media blames the collapse of real estate for the past 2-years of market underperformance, this is true, but not because its hurting Chinese people's financial health. It's the severing of trust in the government (that they would bail out the real estate firms and save the people's money and investment properties) that is the problem. The Chinese gross savings ratio sits at \~44%  - unlike US consumers and investors (US personal savings rate is 3%) who CAN'T spend if the market collpases, the Chinese are simply choosing not to consume or invest. 

So what does all this mean? It means the CCP needs to send the strongest possible message to the Chinese people that it will support the market and help the property industry. It doesn't actually have to do anything like a massive bailout, but it needs to be performative and convincing - like the Fed is in the US. Once sentiment swings positive, all that unallocated capital floods right back into the market - especially if it becomes a 'government-approved' medium. 

**Point 2:** And that's exactly what the CCP has done in the past week. It TELEVISED a PBOC announcement on a range of (tbh low-impact) fiscal policies. Then XJP called for an ""emergency"" politburo meeting to implement ""forceful"" rate cuts and support for real estate. They even allowed state-owned-entities (basically government fund managers) to borrow from the PBOC just to buy and prop up broad market indices. This is hugely sentiment swinging. The CCP is essentially saying to its people that ""you can invest safely, we are going to prioritise the market"", and retail is responding. 

The fact that the Chinese market might be having its strongest weekly gain since 2014 is pretty convenient because this coincides with the 2014 bubble when the Chinese government incentivised its citizens to invest in the market - a similar environment to today. What happened then:

1. The CSI almost DOUBLED between late 2014 to mid-2015. 
2. It caused one of the biggest bubbles and crashes in Chinese market history.

IMO if the market is headed for a V-shape recovery, China does not appear to be a long-term play. But there is a lot to be gained from the compressed spring that is Chinese equities rn. China Tech is arguably their strongest suite of stocks (fundamentally) and they have been going absolutely gangbusters over this week. I see strong upside over a 1-year time horizon, with downside risk being political tensions w/ US and CCP failure to follow through with policy support. I would reduce portfolio exposure approaching 2021 stock market peaks in the case of market exuberance. The ideal scenario is a slow-down or even correction to allow for more sustainable recovery. In which case, corrections represent compelling entry-points.

stocks,Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it,"Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals

To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be.   Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration.   But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:  1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter  2) Stock split = $$$    3) My local Costco has long lines   Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury.   A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already.   And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth.   - 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%)   - Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco  - As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend   - Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect   - Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals  - Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not   - eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships",0.0,0.09855489417989419

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,"Rivian Stock , Buy ??? ","Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!",29,0.66,71,1727399852.0,"Rivian Stock , Buy ???

stocks,"A definitive, verifiable GameStop update","There was a comment on this sub after the most recent GameStop earnings asking:

*“With all the attention on GME, I would really appreciate hearing a factual argument about how this is a positive for shareholders and a positive for the future of the company. There seems to be a stark divide between what some people want to happen and what appears to be happening.”*

Here are some Q&A-style answers to that comment and others I’ve seen.

**Why don’t GameStop investors care that revenue is decreasing?**

This is probably the biggest misconception about the company’s outlook – the role of the legacy business.

The pre-2021 main bull case for GameStop stock was not that the company would *definitely* turn itself around, but rather that Wall Street was too eager in pegging it for bankruptcy, resulting in its low stock price. The company *was* struggling, but investors like Keith Gill believed that bankruptcy was further on the horizon, that the secular headwinds were overstated for the near-term, that the company had more time than believed to address those concerns.

Fast-forward to 2024. Bankruptcy has been all but removed from the conversation, though more so due to stock offerings as opposed to the resilience of console gaming. Even so, this still upholds the original bull thesis because now it seems they have all the time in the world to right the ship, right?

Not necessarily. The legacy business is still a liability. I say ""legacy"" because many GME investors (including Gill, per his latest stream) aren't sure physical gaming is the future for this company, but it is the current reality. The company is fine, but the business model is flawed and staring at those same secular headwinds. Therefore, the company’s revenue decrease has been attributed more to efforts to right-size those operations in order to return to profitability, thus minimizing the current business model as a liability. It comes at the expense of revenue, but that’s not as big of a concern as it would have been without the cash hoard income they’ve acquired.

**What** ***are*** **investors looking for in the earnings reports?**

More hints at what the cash reserve will be used for. No real plan laid out at this moment.

**Why doesn’t that bother you?**

From a neutral perspective, it seems reasonable to assume one of two possibilities:

* There isn’t a definitive plan for the cash at this moment.
* If there is a plan, it would likely deploy in one aggressive swoop (based on how Cohen tends to invest), so signaling beforehand may seem imprudent to the board.

PERSONALLY (re: now we’re entering into my speculative bull case), I think the timing of the cash deployment will coincide with one thing – the steadying of revenue.

It seems clear that the board is not interested in expanding into new revenue streams unless they're really sure there's no risk to profit margin, however meager. In my opinion, the moment they see that revenues AND profit are holding steady – in other words, that the legacy business is swimming on its own in its little kiddy pool – we will see cash being deployed.

That’s probably my biggest bull case for the stock in the near-term. I don’t buy that the long-term plan is T-bills for that cash hoard. Whether or not you believe Cohen is a savvy investor, one pattern is very clear – when he bets on something, it’s usually a swing for the fences. I think the market will react intensely to the news that GameStop has started deploying its cash reserves, regardless of what the cash ends up being used for.

 

I caution everyone on this sub and others to avoid dismissing the case for GameStop simply because of its intense online following. I really wish it could be talked about in more neutral terms. The reality of most discussion around it being so hyperbolic (whether negative or positive hyperbole) has made it really hard to seek out good sounding boards for discussion.",2,0.5,176,1727457188.0,"A definitive, verifiable GameStop update","There was a comment on this sub after the most recent GameStop earnings asking:  *“With all the attention on GME, I would really appreciate hearing a factual argument about how this is a positive for shareholders and a positive for the future of the company.

stocks,Ubisoft Shares Sink to Decade Low After ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Delay ,"Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the French video game company cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and delayed the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

Shares fell 19% to €9.25 at 10:27 a.m. in Paris on Thursday, the lowest since November 2013.

While Assassin’s Creed Shadows is “feature complete,” it will now debut Feb. 14 2025, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The game was initially planned for November. The company said it needed more time to improve the game after its recent Star Wars release had underperformed.

Ubisoft has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles. Pushing back the latest Assassin’s Creed title means it skips the lucrative holiday period.

Ubisoft said it now expects bookings of €1.95 billion ($2.2 billion) in fiscal 2025, which ends in March. Analysts were expecting €2.42 billion, on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Net bookings in the fiscal second quarter are now projected to be €350 million to €370 million, the company said. It previously forecast about €550 million.

The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the softer-than-expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,” Ubisoft said.

Star Wars received middling reviews after its August launch. Ubisoft said it would strive to avoid similar mistakes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of the holiday season.

“This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition,” according to Ubisoft. Unlike prior entries in the Assassin’s Creed series, the upcoming title will not include a Season Pass, which supplied new content in exchange for an added fee.

The latest guidance miss is Ubisoft’s fifth in six years, said analysts Doug Creutz and Mei Lun Quach from TD Cowen. The board has not held management accountable for “repeated failures in a way that serves the interest of external shareholders,” they added.

“Ubisoft has both high-quality game IP and talented developers; despite that, the last six years have been an almost non-stop parade of game delays, followed by game launches that are still undercooked, as well as misallocation of capital to games that probably never should have been green-lit in the first place,” they said.

I'm looking at moving my S&P 500 stocks from cash to dividend paying. 

The stocks I found for dividend paying are much larger to purchase. So I could purchase 10 or so. Now if they pay dividends, does that mean the stock goes up in value? Rather than paying say 1 or a portion of a stock.

As you can't buy a portion of a stock, does this mean I'd need a much larger portfolio to start with these? Or can they pay a portion? 

Probably a simple question, but all advice I've found simply it's pays dividends back into the fund.

Boeing’s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.

""The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,"" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.""

Earlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in “direct talks” after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.

Nevertheless, Boeing’s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.

“Boeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they’re losing between $100 million and $150 million,” Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.

Without union workers based in Boeing’s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company’s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.

Mendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.

“It’s not just Boeing that’s in trouble — the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,” Mendiratta said. “When there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.”

Mendiratta doesn’t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing’s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.

stocks,"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ","Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

stocks,Google files EU antitrust complaint accusing Microsoft of stifling cloud competition ,"Google filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.

At the heart of Google’s complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in” clients and exert control over the cloud market.

Google alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.

The internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft’s cloud licensing terms makes it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to competitors’ clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.

European businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers’ ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.

The antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.

Referring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission to dismiss Google’s complaint.

“Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. “Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.”

Microsoft’s cloud ‘tax’ at issue

In a summary of the complaint, Google — which ranks third globally in the cloud computing market behind market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, respectively — said that Microsoft “harms cybersecurity and undermines innovation.”

According to Google, if a company runs Microsoft’s Office suite of productivity tools and other applications on Google Cloud Platform or other competing clouds, they are effectively required to pay a “tax” in the form of punchy licensing fees to Microsoft.

Google said that Microsoft undermined competition in cloud, and referred to findings of a U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study which determined Microsoft acquired over 60% to 70% of all new British businesses in 2021 and 2022.

Google also suggested that Microsoft’s cloud practices have potentially made businesses more prone to security issues.

In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Wednesday, Amit Zavery, Google Cloud’s head of platform, said Google believes Microsoft is “100%” in violation of EU antitrust rules.

“We would like the cloud market to remain and become very vibrant and open for all the providers including European vendors, vendors like us, AWS and others,” Zavery said.

“Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” Zavery said. “Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” he said, adding that Microsoft included restrictions once it realized the massive commercial potential of the technology.

“So, we would want those restrictions to be removed and allow customers to have and choose whatever cloud provider they think is best for them commercially and technically,” he added.

Zavery told CNBC that if Microsoft makes changes to its cloud licensing terms as a result of its complaint, Google and cloud customers more broadly would be “very happy.”

Following the July settlement agreement with Microsoft, CISPE said the tech giant would work with its members to release an enhanced version of Azure Stack HCI, a cloud infrastructure product, to offer the same features that Microsoft customers using its Azure product currently benefit from.

Google, which is not a CISPE member, said it disagreed with the settlement and chose not to participate in the agreement. Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba’s cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.

For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it “firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.”

stocks,Let's discuss - investing psychology/behavioural pitfalls that we fall into,"I find myself in a somewhat odd investment psychology pitfall or trap that is the opportunity cost or FOMO of potential gains, but not losses.

I have had paper losses in my investments of up to five digits are some points, which doesn't bother me emotionally or psychologically at all. However, when it comes to losing out to potential gains, it hits me with almost crippling anxiety and frustration.

For example, 

- selling off a stock after it had made a profit, to see that the price continues to appreciate shortly after,

- taking a stop loss to see that the stock makes a recovery in the very near term (immediate to say 2 weeks out),

- considering and hesitating on buying a stock, to see that it has shot up before I could come to an investment decision whether to buy.

I think what I find strange about this psychology is that I am mentally able to handle paper losses but not the ability to just shake off gains that 'could have been', even though I hadn't actually made any losses or even made smaller gains than what it potentially got to in the near future. 

I guess by writing it down, I am trying to verbalise my thoughts and emotions to make sense of it, deal with it, hopefully overcome it, and would like hear from others what goes through their minds when they are doing investments.

Do you experience any investing psychology or pitfalls yourself?

Anyone else been in a similar mental state as I am, and how did you overcome it if you did?

stocks,Amphastar (AMPH) growth potential 2025 onwards,"Here is full weekend analysis I completed recently. Enjoy

**DESCRIPTION**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. The company also provides insulin APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) used in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. A key driver of Amphastar's recent performance is its acquisition of BAQSIMI®, **the first and only** nasally administered glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.

**Executive Summary**

Amphastar continues to leverage its technical expertise in complex generics and proprietary products. The company announced net revenues of $644.4 million for 2023, a substantial increase from $499.0 million in 2022. Similarly, financial results for the second quarter of 2024 are similarly strong, with net revenues growing to $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. The recent acquisition of BAQSIMI® and the company’s expanding product line signal continued growth.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capitalize on its diverse portfolio of over 25 commercial products, robust pipeline, and growing manufacturing capabilities. While the company's recent acquisitions, such as BAQSIMI®, and its focus on niche markets have strengthened its position in the injectable and inhalation markets, further developments and successful integration of these strategic moves will be crucial in determining its leadership in these sectors.

**Market At Large**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals falls under the pharmaceuticals industry and can be classified as a drug manufacturer that specializes in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generic drugs.

The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow significantly, driven by an aging population, and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. The U.S. injectable drug market was valued at $340 billion in 2023, with Amphastar targeting over $11 billion in opportunities within the space. Additionally, the U.S. inhalation market is valued at $29 billion, where Amphastar’s Primatene MIST® has captured significant market share. The injectable drug market alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in the next decade.

Research supports the findings in annual reports. Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. In 2022, published by Parker et al. on November 1st, 2023, stated that In 2022, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, 1 in 4 health care dollars spent in the U.S. is related to the care of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, with 61% of these costs being directly attributable to diabetes.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capture a share of this growing market due to its focus on diabetes-related products, particularly with its acquisition of BAQSIMI®. With diabetes care accounting for such a significant portion of healthcare spending, Amphastar’s expanding presence in this space provides a substantial growth opportunity.

**Company & Business Description**

Amphastar’s diversified product line includes injectable, intranasal, and inhalation products. Its portfolio spans over 25 marketed products, including Primatene MIST®, BAQSIMI®, Glucagon for Injection, and REXTOVYTM. The company’s pipeline includes over 20 product candidates, many of which leverage Amphastar’s core strengths in drug delivery technology, particle engineering, and API manufacturing.

Amphastar’s business model includes both selling proprietary products and manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are sold to other pharmaceutical companies.

Key strengths include its vertically integrated infrastructure, which enables the company to oversee all stages of product development from research through commercialization. Amphastar's international expansion is highlighted by the acquisition of BAQSIMI®, which is sold in 27 countries.

**Management**

Jack Y. Zhang, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, has led the company since 1996. With over 35 years of experience in chemistry and management, Dr. Zhang has driven Amphastar’s growth through his deep technical expertise and leadership. He holds several patents and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Founder-led businesses like Amphastar often outperform peers due to the founder’s personal stake, long-term vision, and deep understanding of the company. Dr. Zhang’s leadership, combining scientific knowledge and operational management, is a key driver of Amphastar’s success.

**Financial Statements**

Amphastar’s financial performance in 2023 was marked by strong revenue growth and profitability. Total net revenues were $644.4 million, with a gross margin of 49.7%. The company’s net income reached $137.5 million, a significant increase from $91.4 million in 2022.

For Q2 2024, Amphastar reported total revenues of $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the same period in 2023. Gross profit also saw a substantial rise to $95.2 million, representing a 31% gross margin, up from $72.7 million a year ago. This was mainly driven by the growth in the sale of BAQSIMI® and Primatene MIST® along with robust performance from its insulin API business.

The company’s balance sheet remains solid, with cash and equivalents of $189.6 million as of June 30, 2024. Amphastar can comfortably cover its current liabilities, but the company has significant long-term debt primarily due to the acquisition of BAQSIMI®. While the company has been actively managing its debt, the liquidity position is still strong, allowing Amphastar to invest in R&D and consider further strategic acquisitions or product development.

Amphastar’s retained earnings grew significantly, reaching $490.4 million as of June 30, 2024, up from $409.3 million at the end of 2023. This is is a positive indicator of profitability and financial health.

Amphastar has $255.8 million in treasury stock, up from $247.4 million at the end of 2023. This increase reflects the company’s continued buyback activity, demonstrating confidence in its own stock and a commitment to enhancing shareholder value by reducing the outstanding share count.

The company reported -$24.3 million in net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2024. Despite not issuing new shares, Amphastar made debt-related payments (including principal repayments on long-term debt), engaged in share buybacks, and made equity plan payments. The absence of new common share issuance can be a positive signal for investors, as it shows the company is not diluting existing shareholders, and the continued share repurchases signal management’s confidence in the company's future.

**BAQSIMI® Acquisition**

BAQSIMI® (glucagon), a dry nasal spray used in an emergency for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes ages four years and above, is the first and only nasally administered glucagon. It is compact, portable and ready to use in a single, fixed 3mg dose.

On June 30, 2023, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals completed the acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly & Company. The total deal value was $628.1 million, including a $500 million upfront cash payment, deferred payments, and potential contingent payments of up to $450 million based on sales milestones:

1. *$100 million*: If annual net sales of BAQSIMI® and related products reach $175 million within the first five years after acquisition.
2. *Two payments of $100 million each*: If annual net sales reach $200 million in any year during the same period.
3. *$150 million*: If cumulative net sales of $950 million are achieved within the first five years.

In addition, the company entered into agreements with Lilly to ensure a smooth transition, including a Manufacturing Services Agreement for continued production and a Transition Services Agreement to support clinical and commercial operations for up to 18 months.

BAQSIMI® strengthens Amphastar’s position in the diabetes care market, providing immediate revenue growth and expanding the company’s global footprint into 27 countries. The company expects BAQSIMI® to generate substantial long-term value, with a product lifespan of 24 years.

The deal was funded through a $700 million credit facility, demonstrating the company’s financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities.

**BAQSIMI® Sales 2021-2024**

The sales data for BAQSIMI® has been sourced from both Eli Lilly and Amphastar’s annual and quarterly reports. 

Noteworthy points include:

* 2022 Full Year: BAQSIMI® generated $252.7 million in total sales, with $207 million coming from the U.S. and $45.7 million from international markets.
* 2023 Q2: Eli Lilly reported a significant sales surge of $613.9 million as the company worked to deplete its inventory following the announcement of BAQSIMI®'s sale to Amphastar.
* 2023 Full Year: Total sales for BAQSIMI® amounted to $746.4 million.
* 2024 H1: Sales slowed, totaling $61.9 million by mid-year, likely reflecting transitional factors associated with the Manufacturing and Transition Services Agreements between Eli Lilly and Amphastar.

This data highlights the fluctuations in BAQSIMI® sales leading up to its full transfer to Amphastar in 2025, where a more consistent growth trajectory is expected.

**Future Outlook**

Total revenues from finished pharmaceutical products for 2023, 2022, and 2021 amounted to $579.1 million, $486.5 million and $419.6 million, respectively. This is significant as it forms the baseline revenue for Amphastar's core business.

Amphastar’s acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly is expected to significantly boost its revenue starting in 2025, once the company takes over the manufacturing and direct sales. Prior to Amphastar's control, Eli Lilly's inventory depletion efforts in 2023 Q2 led to an extraordinary $613.9 million in total BAQSIMI® sales. However, the drop in sales afterward reflects a period where Eli Lilly’s sales incentives waned due to the transitional agreements, resulting in lower sales during 2023 H2 and 2024 H1.

**Once Amphastar assumes full control in 2025 Q1, the alignment of sales incentives will likely restore BAQSIMI’s growth trajectory.**

BAQSIMI®’s future potential is substantial, particularly as the glucagon market grows and Amphastar expands all its products internationally, especially in China and Europe. This acquisition aligns with Amphastar's long-term strategy of expanding its branded product portfolio, improving operational efficiencies, and capturing high-margin niche markets.

**Valuation**

Given Amphastar's current P/E of 15.30 and forward P/E of 17x based on 2024 estimates. I disagree with analysts on that because BAQSIMI® is likely to be accretive to earnings starting from 2025 more than expected.

My Sales Scenarios for 2025-2029:

1. Moderate Growth Scenario:

Amphastar steadily grows BAQSIMI® sales from $200 million in 2025 to $400 million by 2029.

Existing products grow at a stable rate of around 5% year-over-year, starting from $579.1 million in 2023.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $400 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.13 billion

2) Optimistic Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® hits $250 million in 2025 and reaches $500 million by 2029.

Existing products maintain a similar growth trajectory.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $500 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.23 billion

3) Aggressive Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® reaches $300 million by 2025 and $700 million by 2029, reflecting the higher sales potential.

Existing product revenues remain steady, growing alongside BAQSIMI®.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $700 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.43 billion

Rationale:

* **Existing Product Sales**: Amphastar’s diversified product portfolio is generating strong and stable revenues. This provides a solid foundation for the company’s future growth.
* **BAQSIMI® Contribution**: Given its potential as a high-margin product, BAQSIMI® will accelerate Amphastar’s revenue growth and drive profitability once manufacturing and sales incentives are aligned in 2025.
* **Synergies**: The company’s strategy of expanding its branded portfolio and increasing its presence in niche markets supports its premium valuation, especially with BAQSIMI®’s global market potential.

Amphastar’s diversification into proprietary products, combined with its ability to navigate regulatory processes and execute complex acquisitions, adds a premium to its valuation.

If Amphastar can achieve the optimistic or aggressive revenue growth projections, along with corresponding improvements in profitability, it is likely that the market will recognize this performance by significantly re-rating the stock. Companies that demonstrate sustained top-line and bottom-line growth, particularly in high-margin, high-demand segments, often command higher valuation multiples. In such cases, it would not be unusual for Amphastar to enjoy a P/E ratio of 30 or higher, in line with other high-growth pharmaceutical companies that successfully capitalize on niche market leadership and product innovation.

**Risks**

* **Supply Chain Constraints**: Amphastar relies on single-source suppliers for key raw materials, especially for complex products like BAQSIMI®. Any disruptions could impact production and sales, particularly during the transition post-acquisition.
* **Price Sensitivity**: Pricing pressures from healthcare reforms and competition, including biosimilars, could affect margins. Maintaining BAQSIMI®'s profitability in a competitive market will be essential.
* **Geopolitical Risks**: The company’s operations in China are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions, which could affect manufacturing and supply chain stability.
* **Competitive Pressure**: Increased competition from larger pharmaceutical companies could erode market share, especially in glucagon products like BAQSIMI®.
* **Regulatory Risks**: Delays in regulatory approvals for new products and BAQSIMI®’s integration in international markets could impact sales timelines.
* **Acquisition Integration**: Smooth integration of BAQSIMI® post-transition is critical to achieving projected sales growth. Any delays could hinder short-term performance.

**CATALYSTS**

* **Successful integration and ramp-up of BAQSIMI®:** With BAQSIMI® expected to significantly contribute to revenues post-2025, its integration and performance under Amphastar’s management will be critical.
* **REXTOVY™ approval and commercial launch:** The rollout of this naloxone nasal spray product will diversify Amphastar’s emergency treatment offerings and strengthen its foothold in opioid overdose treatments.
* **Expansion of Primatene MIST® and insulin biosimilars:** Continued growth in these key product lines, along with new biosimilars in the pipeline, will drive future revenue streams and enhance market penetration.
* **Strategic international expansion through BAQSIMI® channels:** Amphastar’s ability to leverage BAQSIMI®’s established presence in over 27 countries will be instrumental in accelerating international growth.
* **Ongoing share repurchases:** The company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through stock buybacks will further enhance investor confidence.",7,0.82,0,1727278351.0,Amphastar (AMPH) growth potential 2025 onwards,"Here is full weekend analysis I completed recently. Enjoy  **DESCRIPTION**  Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. The company also provides insulin APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) used in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. A key driver of Amphastar's recent performance is its acquisition of BAQSIMI®, **the first and only** nasally administered glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.  **Executive Summary**  Amphastar continues to leverage its technical expertise in complex generics and proprietary products. The company announced net revenues of $644.4 million for 2023, a substantial increase from $499.0 million in 2022. Similarly, financial results for the second quarter of 2024 are similarly strong, with net revenues growing to $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. The recent acquisition of BAQSIMI® and the company’s expanding product line signal continued growth.  Amphastar is well-positioned to capitalize on its diverse portfolio of over 25 commercial products, robust pipeline, and growing manufacturing capabilities. While the company's recent acquisitions, such as BAQSIMI®, and its focus on niche markets have strengthened its position in the injectable and inhalation markets, further developments and successful integration of these strategic moves will be crucial in determining its leadership in these sectors.  **Market At Large**  Amphastar Pharmaceuticals falls under the pharmaceuticals industry and can be classified as a drug manufacturer that specializes in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generic drugs.  The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow significantly, driven by an aging population, and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. The U.S. injectable drug market was valued at $340 billion in 2023, with Amphastar targeting over $11 billion in opportunities within the space. Additionally, the U.S. inhalation market is valued at $29 billion, where Amphastar’s Primatene MIST® has captured significant market share. The injectable drug market alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in the next decade.  Research supports the findings in annual reports. Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. In 2022, published by Parker et al. on November 1st, 2023, stated that In 2022, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, 1 in 4 health care dollars spent in the U.S. is related to the care of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, with 61% of these costs being directly attributable to diabetes.  Amphastar is well-positioned to capture a share of this growing market due to its focus on diabetes-related products, particularly with its acquisition of BAQSIMI®. With diabetes care accounting for such a significant portion of healthcare spending, Amphastar’s expanding presence in this space provides a substantial growth opportunity.  **Company & Business Description**  Amphastar’s diversified product line includes injectable, intranasal, and inhalation products.

DoJ to allege Visa monopolized U.S. debit card market - report

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Visa (V.N), opens new tab shares fell 3% on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to file a lawsuit against the world's largest payment processor, alleging it illegally monopolized the country's debit-card market.

The antitrust division of the regulator is set to file a lawsuit as soon as Tuesday, accusing Visa of a range of anti-competitive conduct, Bloomberg News reported, opens new tabon Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We believe this is an immediate negative to shares but we caution these types of antitrust cases are notoriously known for long/winding paths in the U.S.,"" boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

FRESH ANTITRUST SCRUTINY

The company has been facing heightened scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for years, battling allegations of a duopoly with Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab . Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.
""The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.

""It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.""

News of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.
Brokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.
The prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to ""see the intentions of the next administration,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.

""If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.""

stocks,Blackstone and Vista to acquire software maker Smartsheet for $8.4 billion ,"Collaboration software maker Smartsheet announced Tuesday Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners will acquire it in an all-cash deal valuing the company at about $8.4 billion.

Stockholders will receive $56.50 per share, a 41% premium to Smartsheet’s average closing price over the last three months.

The company had been gauging interest from potential acquirers for several months. The company went public in 2018 and sought to go head-to-head with other software companies like Atlassian.

“As we look to the future, we are confident that Blackstone and Vista’s expertise and resources will help us ensure Smartsheet remains a great place to work where our employees thrive,” CEO Mark Mader said in a release. Shares rose 6% on the news.

The transaction has a 45-day go-shop period, allowing Smartsheet to solicit other bidders. Barring another offer, the transaction is expected to close by January 2025, pending shareholder approval.

Qatalyst advised Smartsheet. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised the private equity bidders.

* **Bank Health**: Poor loan performance can lead to increased loan loss provisions, erosion of investor confidence. (Bear) (High)
* **Federal Reserve Limitations**: The Fed can provide liquidity support but cannot bail out every bank; widespread failures could lead to systemic risk. (Bear) (High)
* **Investor Concerns**: Bad loans can lead to losses for investors; panic can trigger broader market instability. (Bear) (High)

**Final Scores**

* **Bullish Total**: 14 points
* **Bearish Total**: 51 points
* **Neutral Total**: 10 points

The U.S. economy currently displays a predominantly bearish sentiment, characterized by tightening lending practices, inflationary pressures, and risks within the real estate and banking sectors. Key indicators show stable core inflation and moderate year-over-year inflation, while labor market data reveals slowing job growth. Manufacturing indices indicate contraction, with both the NY Empire Index and Philly Fed Index signaling economic softness. Consumer activity shows mixed signals, with strong personal spending but disappointing retail sales in August. Additionally, broader economic risks, including deflation and a stronger dollar, exacerbate market uncertainties.

Overall, the economic data yields a score of 51 points bearish and 14 points bullish, highlighting a cautious outlook amid rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties.

stocks,Clear Secure (YOU) Stock analysis. what do you think about the company?,"Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis  (i dont own any shares of clear)

  

Is a biometric security company which means it produces eye and fingerprint scanners but clear secure markets them skillfully. At airports there are extra clear booths where you can confirm your identity via scanner if you have a clear plus membership and thus skip the line for normal government identity confirmation at the airport.  

  

Clear secure benefits:  

  

Clear secure benefits from unorganized airports by offering a short queue with which you can get identified by eye scan and thus do not have to wait the normal often long waiting time.   

  

Identity checks at airports are already overloaded with queues sometimes hours long and every year more people will travel and fly so it may be worthwhile for people who travel often to buy a Clear plus membership.  

  

So far, clear scanners are only available at 60 airports in the US, so they have a long way to go to expand  

  

Even though their offer is very expensive (199 dollars per year) and only worth it for people who fly 5 times or more per year, you can get it cheaper with credit cards or other offers, for example with tsa precheck in the offer.   

  

clear secure is also partnering with tsa precheck so in the future they can also take over the check-in of tsa precheck subscribers on behalf of tsa precheck which can be a good way to market clear plus and also shows a good cooperation between clear secure and the government.  

  

For the airports, clear secure is also a win because it brings in a lot of money and with decreasing parking revenue, the airports can replace other revenue streams that are getting lower.  

  

Their scan technology can also be used in various locations such as stadiums, offices, stands, etc. they have created a kind of ecosystem with the aim that in the future you can identify yourself everywhere with your face via clear secure and confirm your data such as age identity and vaccination status. other possible locations would be healthcare, clubs casinos etc. so far clear is already active in several stadiums and interesting partnerships are perhaps those with LinkedIn at LinkedIn you can log into your account via clear secure scan for a year now. You can also register at home depot locations using clear secure. what is interesting here is the way in which the manegment is introducing clear secure in different areas, which shows how many places you can use clear scan technology  

  

clear's ceo has been ceo since 2010 and she initiated all the things that make clear the company it is today  

  

Another interesting point is that clear secure has no direct competitors in this type of business other companies that also sell biometric security services such as facial iris and fingerprint scans serve the us government for example IDEMIA and Thales Group also help with their scans at border control or help with tsa checks at the airport they sell to the government but only the technology.  

  

while clear secure pioneered a commercialized customer-facing system with purchasable premium memberships and stand-alone queues at the airport.   

  

As for the clear plus membership retention rate, last year in Q2 it was 90% and has dropped to 80% this year due to a price increase. of course i hope that this trend will not continue but i assume that in the future the retention rate will remain between 80-90%.  

  

Price increases are nothing unusual for Clear but since 2010 the price of the clear plus membership has only been increased twice while the product has grown from two extra lines to 60 extra lines. this year clear has also added a perk to the celar plus membership. there are some discounts for third party services through the membership and there is also a free search service that you can call if you realize you have forgotten or lost something at the airport and they will look it up on their own or help you find it. These perks are nothing earth-shattering, but they at least increase the value of your membership  

  

Balance sheet or income statement related:  

  

Since 2019 they have tripled the revenue from 192 million to 697 million even if I don't expect such a rapid growth Clear can still grow for many years with an annual growth rate of 10-20% as they still have many easy expansion opportunities and their market cap is only 3 billion  

  

Clear has no debt on the balance sheet  

  

  

Clear has a fcf margin of 38% and even though they have issued 2.5% shares this year, 11.5% last year and 7.27% the year before last, now that they are so profitable they want to go other ways and buy back shares. in the earnings call the cfo also said that they are doing this because they want to be shareholder friendly in the long term.  

  

Even if they have done so much equity funding in the last few years, at least their cash flow has grown faster, which is why their fcf per share has grown by an average of 30 percent in the last three years.  

  

Clear secure disadvantages:  

  

One disadvantage that Clear secure definitely has is pricing their premium membership costs 199 dollars per year, if you look at platforms like reddit or trustpilot one reason for the one star rating is that it is expensive and not worth the price.  

  

or normal consumers this is true even if you assume that the average family flies maybe twice a year it is not worth it for them because that 199 dollars is also a larger percentage of their annual income. This definitely limits clear secures customer base to wealthier people who would just do anything at the airport to make it go faster or maybe people who have to fly very often due to their job so their cost per use is so low that it's worth it  

  

Another concern started with a case in 2022 in which a man who wanted to smuggle ammunition despite a false identity tricked such a clear secure scanner, which of course caused the share price to fall sharply and also with a reason: if the machines are not 100% secure, you don't need them. Clear Secure responded quickly with a new system that scans not only the eyes and fingerprints but also the face, assuring clear secure that they are 100% secure even though no major case has happened since then and face scanning is also relatively secure, clear secure is of course now subject to stricter controls and if such a case happens again, clear secure could be punished more severely.  

  

Another threat is that airports could become more efficient so that a costly overhaul line like clear is no longer needed as mentioned earlier many biometric security companies sell their technology to the government and with enough of these scanners equipped the queues should not be that long. Firstly, of course we don't know what the future holds, but airports have always been completely overcrowded during the peak travel times and I don't see that changing  

  

The last and I think also one of the strongest contra points against investing in clear secure is:  

  

in the end, clear secure at airports (their main buisness) is an overtaking rod for those who want to afford it and that is of course a thorn in the side of every people-oriented politician.   

  

airports are financed by tax money and so instead of offering clear secure for the money, they should make the airport more efficient in general. but if an airport earns millions a year from its clear secure line, why should it do that? For the population that can't afford clear secure, that's obviously bad.  

  

In addition, according to some, the state should not hand over its security processes to private companies, but as far as that is concerned, I don't believe that clear secure lines will be abolished by airports in the future either. clear secure works closely with the state programs tsa and tsa precheck, as I said, in the future clear staff will be able to check in tsa precheck members and there are already lines in cooperation with tsa precheck that combine the two advantages so that there is a clear plus + tsa precheck line at several airports.  

  

Voluation:  

  

Clear secure PE ratio is 42 and the P/FCF ratio is 11, this big difference is due to the fact that clear secure has become profitable very quickly in the last few years in terms of free cash flow and the net income margin is not quite there yet while the FCF margin is just at 38% the net income margin is still at 10% stock based compensation is also not really meaningful that it would make such a difference.  

  

In the future, the FCF margin should in any case remain between 40% and 30% and the net income margin should also move up to 30%.  

  

Conclusion  

  

I am actually interested in the company and could also imagine opening a clear secur position in the future, as I expect a long period of sales growth and the risk factors outweigh the positive aspects.

Citing recent data on consumer and producer prices, Waller told CNBC that the data is showing core inflation, excluding food and energy, in the Fed’s preferred measure is running below 1.8% over the past four months. The Fed targets annual inflation at 2%.

“That is what put me back a bit to say, wow, inflation is softening much faster than I thought it was going to, and that is what put me over the edge to say, look, I think 50 [basis points] is the right thing to do,” Waller said during an interview with CNBC’s Steve Liesman.

Both the consumer and producer price indexes showed increases of 0.2% for the month. On a 12-month basis, the CPI ran at a 2.5% rate.

However, Waller said the more recent data has shown an even stronger trend lower, thus giving the Fed space to ease more as it shifts its focus to supporting the softening labor market.

> The Federal Trade Commission on Friday sued three large U.S. health companies that negotiate insulin prices, arguing the drug middlemen boost their profits while “artificially” inflating costs for patients.  The suit targets the three biggest so-called pharmacy benefit managers, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx, CVS Health’s
 Caremark and Cigna’s Express Scripts. All are owned by or connected to health insurers and collectively administer about 80% of the nation’s prescriptions, according to the FTC.  The FTC’s lawsuit also includes each PBM’s affiliated group purchasing organization, which brokers drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers. PBMs sit at the center of the drug supply chain in the U.S. They negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and federal health plans. They also create lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions. The FTC has been investigating PBMs since 2022. 

> The agency’s suit argues that the three PBMs have created a “perverse” drug rebate system that prioritizes high rebates from drugmakers, which leads to “artificially inflated insulin list prices.” It also alleges that PBMs favor those high-list-price insulins even when more affordable insulins with lower list prices become available.  “Millions of Americans with diabetes need insulin to survive, yet for many of these vulnerable patients, their insulin drug costs have skyrocketed over the past decade thanks in part to powerful PBMs and their greed,” Rahul Rao, deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.  “The FTC’s administrative action seeks to put an end to the Big Three PBMs’ exploitative conduct and marks an important step in fixing a broken system—a fix that could ripple beyond the insulin market and restore healthy competition to drive down drug prices for consumers,” Rao continued. 

> The FTC said it also remains “deeply troubled” by the role insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Danish company Novo Nordisk and French drugmaker Sanofi  play in higher list prices, according to a release from the agency.

investing, Should I take a low-interest loan and invest?,"Hi all,

I know it's generally not the best practice to take on debt without a clear purpose or to take it just to invest it, but I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I was recently offered a low-interest personal loan (around 2.63% annually for5 years), and I’m considering taking it. The rate is great, but I'm not 100% sure I really need the loan right now

The main reason I'm considering it is to lock in the low-interest rate + aim to buy an apartment (it's in my mind but I have no clear steps or plan in mind).

My question:

Would it make sense to invest part of the loan while I figure things out, or is that too risky? I feel like I don’t need the loan right now, but I also don’t want to regret passing up on this low-rate opportunity.

Any advice or perspectives would be appreciated!

I have about 100,000 USD that was in my HYSA earning 4.25% APY. I used to get $350per month in interest.

I bought T-Bills that had YTM of 4.72% and with maturity date of 25 days in the future. With 4.72% YTM, I was able to get T-Bills for a discount of $280.

investing,What is my best course of action to do with my old 401k and TSP accounts?,"Hello all,

I’ve been doing a lot of research and going back and forth for the past few months trying to figure out my best options and I thought I would see what kind of insight this community could provide.

I’ve started to focus on my future financial security; and in doing so I remembered I had a profit-sharing plan with a company I was employed by for a relatively brief timeframe after exiting military service. It has been about 7 years since I left the company and therefore have not been contributing to it. The account has approximately $14,500 in it and has grown on average $1,000 per year since I left the company. 

My question(s) is what I should do with it since I cannot contribute to it. Should I just leave it as it is and let it continue to grow so I remain more diversified? Should I withdraw it and put as much as I can into my Roth IRA? Should I transfer it into a different type of investment account within Vanguard that I have more control over?

I also have nearly the same question with my TSP account that has roughly $4,500 in it. I don’t believe I’ll be returning to federal service, but I’m not 100% sure, so I’m just not sure of what I should with it either.

A few things to note: I am 32. I do not currently have a 401k that I’m actively contributing to, only a Roth IRA. I am considered to be permanently disabled through the VA, so from my understanding I would not be subject to the early withdrawal penalties. My goal is to build wealth for retirement and basically have the money go to work for me and get the most ‘bang for my buck.’

I was very curious and surprised at the same time thinking to myself ""wow, this is an opportunity to make some money flipping used phones"".

investing,Gold bars at Costco - is sale volume due to arbitage play?,"Gold bars have been selling like crazy for the past 1-2 years at Costco.  But gold prices change by the minute whereas the Costco price is fixed for periods of time.  

I had wondered why they keep selling out.  I realize that gold has been on the rise recently, but long term (40 years) it gets crushed by the SP500 and the same problem of safe storage continues to exist. I think any serious long or short term investors of gold would just buy the ETF's comprised predominantly of gold bars.  Then you have no storage issues and high liquidity.

Are people just trying to play arbitrage and if the price of gold increases, they'll buy any and all they can at Costco below market price, and just dump it at market to capture the profit margin?  I suppose if gold decreased in value, they could just return it to Costco.  I'm just curious - not considering backing the truck up to Costco :)

Jerome Powell has not stated that these interest rate cuts are aimed at improving the economy or the labor market. Instead, he mentioned that the cuts are intended to prevent further deterioration of the situation. This suggests that our current conditions are more about managing potential decline rather than signaling significant improvements.

Jerome powl said we are cutting interest rates so we don't make things worse. so this means these current conditions we have its about how good it gets nothing more.

investing,Commoditized and Cyclical Stocks: Trade or Own - Some Thoughts & Strategy,"I was writing elsewhere about trading Micron and other memory chip producers rather than investing in them earlier today and thought this snippet would make a really interesting topic of conversation amongst this groups Redditors.

My basic premise is that even when sharing an industry where some companies share almost everything in common except some lean much more towards simpler commoditized products compared to specialized ones and because of varying degrees, lengths and runs/drawdowns tied to cyclicality. 

It was Micron's recent earnings that got me on the topic, and I basically argue that these stocks *can* make you a lot of money if you just buy-and-hold. However, they are likely to be better for your bottom line in the long-run if you trade them, specifically swing trading (usually over a 1 - 6 month period during which the fastest growth is taking place. Even cyclicals with massive long-term gains aren't as good as less cyclical members of the same industry with large expected long-term gains even if a bit less expected growth than cyclicals. Not only do cyclicals tend to gain a larger share of their total growth in only part of the cycle before possibly losing half those gains over the next parts of the cycle means that there is a major opportunity cost to just holding while they stagnate or fall month over month, and in some cases for several years. Moreover, you can better time the market with cyclicals than with most stock.

+The *nice thing about timing the memory market* is that the commoditized nature of most, but not all, memory chips keeps these companies closely in sync throughout their cycles - and one suddenly starting to get ahead of where the rest are is often a pretty good sign that the others will follow shortly thereafter. You don't get many surprises in a countercyclical direction. This is why I bought MU recently close to 80 and just sold in after hours right after earnings, very nice bit of profit for something I held for less than a month. Indeed, though I believe MU was probably a good hold for a couple more quarters - possibly more as this cycle should be elongated due to secular tailwinds - but it was always going to reverse course and if I don't intend on holding for a year at least then I don't like to hold onto the stock for very long. If I'm flipping it, I'm not waiting 9 months, I'm going to take hold of an imminent catalyst, buy as close to earnings as possible assuming that is the expected catalyst and sell either in after market or pre-market before the trading session following earnings begins. If you get your limit orders submitted into after hours before earnings are released, the moment earnings are released tends to see very large, wild swings in both directions in a very short period of time (less than 5 minutes, and lucky if that). Traders who don't smartly set limits try to ascertain whether to expect a big jump or fall within seconds of the initial numbers coming out while most people will not make moves until at least the next trading session. So right as earnings get released, the stock with earnings tends to see volume at its lowest for the quarter and therefore the sudden rapid fire selling and buying by every type of investor, hedge fund and algo.",1,0.6,0,1727532894.0,Commoditized and Cyclical Stocks: Trade or Own - Some Thoughts & Strategy,"I was writing elsewhere about trading Micron and other memory chip producers rather than investing in them earlier today and thought this snippet would make a really interesting topic of conversation amongst this groups Redditors.

This is why I bought MU recently close to 80 and just sold in after hours right after earnings, very nice bit of profit for something I held for less than a month. Indeed, though I believe MU was probably a good hold for a couple more quarters - possibly more as this cycle should be elongated due to secular tailwinds - but it was always going to reverse course and if I don't intend on holding for a year at least then I don't like to hold onto the stock for very long. If I'm flipping it, I'm not waiting 9 months, I'm going to take hold of an imminent catalyst, buy as close to earnings as possible assuming that is the expected catalyst and sell either in after market or pre-market before the trading session following earnings begins. If you get your limit orders submitted into after hours before earnings are released, the moment earnings are released tends to see very large, wild swings in both directions in a very short period of time (less than 5 minutes, and lucky if that). Traders who don't smartly set limits try to ascertain whether to expect a big jump or fall within seconds of the initial numbers coming out while most people will not make moves until at least the next trading session. So right as earnings get released, the stock with earnings tends to see volume at its lowest for the quarter and therefore the sudden rapid fire selling and buying by every type of investor, hedge fund and algo.",0.6,0.12751728110599075

investing,I had a revelation about why I invest,"
This is my revelation:

1. I work and get paid in fiat. Now, I don’t go to work every day only for the money - that would make it to onerous. There is some positive social aspect to work and it does give some structure and helps with self-image etc. But fundamentally, we exchange our time for fiat.

2. That fiat which we earn in exchange for our time and effort is constantly getting devalued because of inflation and the governments printing money to keep liquidity pumping. Governments also like to print money to devalue their debt, especially in USA which has the good fortune of having its debt denominated in its own currency.

3. Hence, we can only win by taking our excess fiat (I.e., what we earn from employer less taxes and less what we spend to live our day-to-day lives) and buying various assets with it. 

4. Real estate is a great asset because we don’t need to pay in full for it up-front, and can use leverage to build wealth. For instance, I paid $500k down (which in turn came entirely from the profits of selling a previous house which I had bought for $40k down) to buy a $2M house as few years ago. That house has appreciated 50% (which is not a super high figure) to $3M today. Meanwhile I have paid off about $300k of the loan using a low 2.6% mortgage, so I have $1.8M in equity. My original $500k plus $300k = $800k has more than doubled to $1.8M.

5. Stocks is next. Been buying with every paycheck and now accumulated $2.5M stock portfolio, mostly S&P500 index fund.

6. Bitcoin is the great diversifier and turbo-charger. I only got into Bitcoin in 2021 amid the previous bull market hype. But since then I have been buying Bitcoin every so often with fiat leftover after stock purchases. So, now I have 3.04 Bitcoin which at today’s $66k price is worth $200k. I will continue to buy a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin every month. I don’t know how much Bitcoin will rise over the next decade, but as long as it goes up faster than S&P index it would have been a good move.

So, my revelation is to turn your excess fiat each month into hard assets - real estate, stocks and Bitcoin. Don’t hold too much cash. I only hold $100k in cash as emergency account. That’s all.

I want to buy XEQT but everywhere I see on this sub is people telling people not to mix VFV and XEQT. Would it be silly to just keep my TFSA in VFV and my RRSP in XEQT, and just be global but over diversified in the SP500? Am I missing why this is a bad idea?   ",0.0,-0.0985042735042735

investing,How wise is it to invest in the stock markets of some growing third world countries in order to get higher risk and higher rewards? ,"I have noticed in the past years that the stock markets of some third world countries have grown more, of course it is riskier, but somehow investing in these countries seems to me to be a sensible idea, even though the United States of America continues to grow, it is not so fast because it is already developed. But when we look at the third world countries, there are countries that have the potential to develop very quickly.

That's not the only reason. Also, sometimes there are important events that will increase certain share prices. If we look at the world as a whole, we can profit more easily than if we just look at events that happen in the US.

For example, something a head of state says or an action they take can cause specific stocks to go up or down obviously a lot. I believe that if I follow the world news constantly, I can benefit from it.

What do you think?

investing,Portfolio Diversification Advice?,"Hello👋 

I’ve been investing off and on for a while now, but barely got to the point in my life where I can consistently invest weekly. Been going strong for about a year now. 

Currently, I am putting $600 to $800 per month into what I call my long term high dividend return portfolio. I have only 4 different stocks that pay above or close to 10 percent in dividends. 

Any idea on what I could or should add? What other sectors might out perform in the near or distant future. Just looking for general insight or maybe some examples of how you guys run your portfolios?

investing,Ben Felix Factor Model Portfolio?,"What do people think of his portfolio suggestion and factor investing?

I’ve been diving into Ben Felix’s content and came across his factor-based investing approach, which emphasizes things like “The Ben Felix Model Portfolio is a globally diversified investment strategy that utilizes index funds and tilts towards specific factors, such as size, value, and profitability (factor investing). It is developed by Ben Felix and Cameron Passmore of PWL Capital, a Canadian financial management firm.”


 I’m curious to hear what others think about it!

Have any of you incorporated a factor model portfolio like his into your strategy?

How’s it performing compared to a typical index-based portfolio (e.g., VTI or VOO)?

Do you think the factor tilt is worth it for long-term investors?

Appreciate any insights or personal experiences!

investing,Helping my father with investing. Where to park $2mil for foreseeable future?,"My dad is in a great place financially, but his investment portfolio is geared much more towards his past needs than current needs. He retired at 50 and relied somewhat on high yield dividend producers for income. He is now aged early 60’s and has ~$325k income independent of his stock portfolio. Pension and farm/solar leases making up most of it.    
    
His stock portfolio is presently providing over $150k in unnecessary income. He lives a simple life and has no debt in a very LCOL area. $300k is more than sufficient for his lifestyle. The taxes on the extra income are just foolish and unnecessary at this point. Looking to move to growth and a bit more stability whilst eliminating most if not all dividend income from portfolio. He does have a penchant for a bit more aggressive gambling in the long term growth market, and would want to allocate 10-20% towards a chance at higher rewards.
